<h2>Questions before you choose an antispam product</h2>
<p>

Here is a (commercial vendor suggested) list of important questions to ask any anti-spam
vendor in order to asses his ability to effectively block spam:<p>

<a href="#q11">What is defined as spam email by the vendor?</a><br>
<a href="#q12">How spam emails are collected for analysis?</a><br>
<a href="#q13">How frequently anti-spam rules and/or spam signatures are updated and sent to customer?</a><br>
<a href="#q14">Does the product check for embedded URLs against categorized database and how big is this database?</a><br>
<a href="#q15">What additional security features does the product provide to minimize exposure to spam?</a><br>
<a href="#q16">Is there a 24/7 monitoring and automatic reaction for spam attacks?</a><br>
<a href="#q17">Does it require tuning and constant maintenance of anti-spam filters?</a><br>
<a href="#q18">How much time from the product installation will it take the administrator to tune the system to effectively block spam?</a><br>
<a href="#q19">Does the product support remote quarantine management and what actions can be taken on quarantines spam?</a><br>
<a href="#q20">Can the product handle high volume email traffic?</a><br>
<a href="#q21">What operating systems the product supports?</a><br>

<strong><a name="q11">What is defined as spam email by the vendor?</a></strong><p>

I do not define anything as spam for you. If you want my spam folder I may give it to you.
Statistical filters (like clapf) give you the freedom to determine yourself what is spam
and what is ham (=good email).<p>

I believe no vendor database gives you the flexibility and the accuracy for catching spam.
I compared the accuracy of clapf with a commercial product (from an antivirus vendor).
Conclusion: clapf caught 406 of 408 spam scoring 99.5% accuracy while the commercial
product got only 158 of 408 spam scoring ~38% accuracy. You may have a better commercial
(and vendor dependant) product but I think they are not even close to clapf.<p>

I did a short test for a week (2006.03.06-13) and I caught 351 of 354 spam (99.15%)
with no false positives (271 of 271 ham = 100%). The overall accuracy is 99.52% (622 of 625).
This is my result for a specific time duration, of course yours could be different.<p>

I was curious about the accuracy if I would continue the test. So I continued to count
 the results (2006.03.06-21) and I caught 630 of 633 spam (99.52%)
with no false positives (612 of 612 ham = 100%). The overall accuracy is 99.75% (1242 of 1245).<p>

My record so far is 99.9% during a 2 weeks test (actually it was 15 days), clapf miscategorised
1 message from 1001, ie. one spam slipped in with no false positives.<p/>

<table border="1">
<tr align="center">
<td>duration [days]</td>
<td>ham</td>
<td>spam</td>
<td>accuracy [%]</td>

<tr align="center">
<td>7</td><td>271/271</td><td>351/354</td><td>99.52</td>
</tr>

<td>14</td><td>612/612</td><td>630/633</td><td>99.75</td>
</tr>

<strong><a name="q12">How spam emails are collected for analysis?</a></strong><p>

I do not collect any email for analysis. I don't think that generally it's a useful thing to
collect someone else's spam. Any statistical filter should be designed to catch your spam
with great efficiency. It's no use for a spam filter to be able to catch a spam you never
get. You benefit nothing from this.<p>


<strong><a name="q13">How frequently anti-spam rules and/or spam signatures are updated and sent to customer?</a></strong><p>

Since clapf creates a database exclusively from your ham and spam emails, it doesn't make sense
if I send you a yearly/monthly/weekly/daily/hourly/... updated uniform spam database.<p>

Clapf works without any ruleset, tough it has a single rule: try to catch all spam with the smallest
false positive ratio.<p>


<strong><a name="q14">Does the product check for embedded URLs against categorized database and how big is this database?</a></strong><p>

Yes. From 0.3.26-rc1 SURBL (<a href="http://www.surbl.org/">http://www.surbl.org/</a>) support is included.
The current SURBL database has more than 817k entries. Clapf is able to use any domain to check URLs against,
you may use <a href="http://www.uribl.com/index.shtml">http://www.uribl.com/index.shtml</a> or even your local
SURBL database too.<p>

Clapf will not reject a message if one of its URL can be found in the SURBL database, rather the message may have
a higher spamicity value, a higher probability that it's spam.<p/>


<strong><a name="q15">What additional security features does the product provide to minimize exposure to spam?</a></strong><p>

Clapf features the blackhole mechanism (an automated internal blacklist).<p>


<strong><a name="q16">Is there a 24/7 monitoring and automatic reaction for spam attacks?</a></strong><p>

No. You may react to spam by training the database. You don't need any vendor interaction for this.
Thus it costs you nothing.<p>

<strong><a name="q17">Does it require tuning and constant maintenance of anti-spam filters?</a></strong><p>

Statistical spam filters must be trained before used effectively. You should have a corpus
of spam as well as a corpus of ham (1500-2000 email per corpus is fine). After this
initial setup you are supposed to train the database occasionally when the filter makes a
mistake classifying an email. No constant maintanance is required.<p>


<strong><a name="q18">How much time from the product installation will it take the administrator to tune the system to effectively block spam?</a></strong><p>

If you already have the two corpuses mentioned above, I should say a few minutes or so.
Please note that setting other (optional) features may take extra time to setup depending
on the status of the prerequisites.<p/>

<strong><a name="q19">Does the product support remote quarantine management and what actions can be taken on quarantines spam?</a></strong><p>

Yes. Clapf comes with a few CGI applications designed to handle the spam quarantine.
The most important feature is that you may train the database with any email the filter
has misclassified. You may forward any email in the spam quarantine to its recipients
and you may train the database with that email (if you want) with a single click. Of
course you may delete any item from the quarantine.<p>


<strong><a name="q20">Can the product handle high volume email traffic?</a></strong><p/>

Sure. You may configure how many paralel requests clapf will accept. This may be a great
number if you have sufficient resources. You may do some tuning, eg. use memory filesystem
to hold temporary files to achieve even better performance. If you have a few low end PC,
you may do load sharing (I recommend this anyway).<p/>

The performance of clapf depends on how many queries it has to issue against the token
database and the type of the database backend. Clapf supports MySQL and CDB backends.
The CDB backend is faster than the MySQL database, but with tuning the MySQL backend
gives reasonable performance.<p/>

Clapf was able to classify my average size email (&lt;40kB) in 50 msec.
The used virus scanner also has influence on the overall performance. The antivirus
product has scanned my messages in ~100 msec.<p/>

I did a small benchmark using a PIII 1GHz, 256 MB box and sent 2000 spam messages (each
6,5kB in size) using clamd and having 32 MB memory based file system for clapf queue and
holding the tokens in the memory.<br/>

It took ~210 sec to read, process and deliver these messages resulting 34k messages per
hour and 820k messages per day.<p>

<strong><a name="q21">What operating systems the product supports?</a></strong><p>

The primary platform is Linux (any distribution). Clapf also compiles on FreeBSD too.<p>
