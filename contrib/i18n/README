Clapf is able to detect the language of the given message.
If you want to add a new language, do the following:

1. Create a (plain) text file (xxx.txt) in your language.
If possible, _DO_NOT_ include meta characters, international
words. Look at en.txt (for English) or hun1.txt (for Hungarian)
for examples.

2. Generate the language map:

./run.sh xxx.txt


It prints out an array like this:

unsigned long long lang_xxx[MAX_NGRAM] = {
   101ULL, 97ULL, 116ULL, 115ULL, 110ULL, 108ULL, 107ULL, 
   105ULL, 122ULL, 114ULL, 109ULL, 111ULL, 18446744073709551593ULL, 103ULL, 

   .... lots of numbers ....

   0
};


3. Copy this array to the end of lang.h, then update the value of NUM_LANG
and append your language (do not forget to replace the string "xxx" with
your language id) to the lang_detected[][NUM_LANG] array.


4. Open lang.c, go to the 124th line, and add your language. The integer
number should be the index of your language.
