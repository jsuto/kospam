1. Always backup your current clapf.conf file

2. Do a "make install" to replace your old binaries, and other stuff.

3. If you already have a clapf.conf file "make install" will not
update it, you should review the newer config file and modify it
according to your settings, then copy it over the old config.

4. (if possible) rebuild the token database, including the
mysql t_token and t_misc tables as the parser might be modified
in newer versions. If you decide to rebuild the token database
issue the following sql commands before using the kcdb_mysql.sh
script:

DROP INDEX t_token_idx ON t_token;
DELETE FROM t_misc;
DELETE FROM t_token;

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

Clapf (as of version 0.3.29) stores tokens as numerical hashes by default.
If you are upgrading from a previous (<0.3.29) version, you must either
recreate the t_token table or add the -DHAVE_NO_64_HASH compile option
to the 'DEFS' section of the Makefile after running the configure script
to keep using the old format t_token table.

I recommend you (if possible at your configuration) to update to the new
format as it makes the MySQL token table smaller in size and it should
produce faster lookups.

If you choose not to rebuild the token database (by dropping the t_misc
and t_token tables) you must update the t_misc table as follows:

ALTER TABLE t_misc CHANGE COLUMN N_HAM nham int unsigned default 0;
ALTER TABLE t_misc CHANGE COLUMN N_SPAM nspam int unsigned default 0;
