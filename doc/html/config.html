<h2>clapf.conf variables</h2>

<h3>general parameters</h3>


<strong>verbosity</strong><p/>
syntax: verbosity=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 1<p/>
The verbosity directive defines what verbosity level clapf will use. The higher value
means more syslog entries. 3 is the info level, and if you want to see the smtp
conversation between postfix and clapf set the verbosity level to least 5 (=debug).<p/>


<strong>hostid</strong><p/>
syntax: hostid=<i>string</i><br/>
default: av-engine.localhost<p/>
The hostid directive defines the value clapf uses in the HELO SMTP command.<p/>


<strong>listen_addr</strong><p/>
syntax: listen_addr=<i>IPv4 address</i><br/>

The listen_addr directive defines on which IPv4 address clapf will listen.<p/>

<strong>listen_port</strong><p/>
syntax: listen_port=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 10025<p/>
The listen_port directive defines on which TCP port clapf will listen.
Since clapf should not be run as root the port number has to be higher than 1024.<p/>


<strong>postfix_addr</strong><p/>
syntax: postfix_addr=<i>IPv4 address</i><br/>
default: 127.0.0.1<p/>
The postfix_addr directive defines the IPv4 address where postfix is waiting for us.
Clapf will inject the message back to this IPv4 address.<p/>


<strong>postfix_port</strong><p/>
syntax: postfix_port=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 10026<p/>
The postfix_port directive defines the port number where postfix is waiting for us.
Clapf will inject the message back to this port.<p/>


<strong>spam_smtp_addr</strong><p>
syntax: spam_smtp_addr=<i>IPv4 address</i><br>
default: 127.0.0.1<p>
The spam_smtp_addr directive defines the address of the mail server can be used for
delivering spam. You should set the address of the computer where your mailboxes are,
but this can be a separate computer too, if you want a distributed configuration.
If you have one computer set this value the same as postfix_addr.<p>


<strong>spam_smtp_port</strong><p>
syntax: spam_smtp_port=<i>number</i><br>
default: 10026<p>
The spam_smtp_port directive defines the port number of the mail server can be used for
delivering spam. You should set the address of the computer where your mailboxes are,
but this can be a separate computer too, if you want a distributed configuration
If you have one computer set this value the same as postfix_port.<p>


<strong>avg_addr</strong><p>
syntax: avg_addr=<i>IPv4 address</i><br>
default: 127.0.0.1<p>
The avg_addr directive defines the IPv4 address where AVG is waiting for us.<p>


<strong>avg_port</strong><p>
syntax: avg_port=<i>number</i><br>
default: 55555<p>
The avg_port directive defines the port number where AVG is waiting for us.<p>


<strong>avast_addr</strong><p>
syntax: avast_addr=<i>IPv4 address</i><br>
default: 127.0.0.1<p>
The avast_addr directive defines the IPv4 address where avast! is waiting for us.<p>


<strong>avast_port</strong><p>
syntax: avast_port=<i>number</i><br>
default: 5036<p>
The avast_port directive defines the port number where avast! is waiting for us.<p>


<strong>kav_socket</strong><p>
syntax: kav_socket=<i>string</i><br>
default: /var/run/aveserver<p>
The kav_socket directive defines the socket path where aveserver is waiting for us.<p>


<strong>drweb_socket</strong><p>
syntax: drweb_socket=<i>string</i><br>
default: /var/drweb/run/.daemon<p>
The drweb_socket directive defines the socket path where drwebd is waiting for us.<p>


<strong>clamd_socket</strong><p>
syntax: clamd_socket=<i>string</i><br>
default: /tmp/clamd<p>
The clamd_socket directive defines the socket path where clamd is waiting for us.<p>


<strong>session_timeout</strong><p/>
syntax: session_timeout=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 420<p/>

The session_timeout directive defines how many seconds a child process is allowed to run before killed by force.
This value should be greater than lmtp_connection_reuse_time_limit (300s by default), because
postfix will not terminate the connection, but reuse it.<p/>


<strong>max_connections</strong><p/>
syntax: max_connections=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 30<p/>

The max_connections directive defines the maximum number of simoultaneous connections
clapf accepts. This value should be greater than the max. number of connections postfix
will open to clapf (by default 20). Please note that your antivirus scanner should be
able to handle at least this number of simoultaneous demands, too. If you use libclamav
you should have enough memory for all the possible maximum number of clapf processes, too.<p/>


<strong>backlog</strong><p>
syntax: backlog=<i>number</i><br>
default: 20<p>
The backlog directive defines the 2nd parameter of the listen() system call.
Please note that this is set when clapf starts up and you should restart clapf
if you change this variable. Please also note that the meaning of this variable
depends on your Unix implementation.<p>


<strong>chrootdir</strong><p/>
syntax: chrootdir=<i>string</i><br/>
default: none<p/>

The chrootdir directive defines the path of the chroot directory. If you chroot clapf
we have to pass the correct path to the temporary queue file to clamd.<p/>

If you are running clapf inside the <i>/myjail</i> directory as the root directory then
set <i>chrootdir=/myjail</i> thus clapf will pass <i>/myjail/opt/av/tmp/xxxxxxx</i> to
clamd for virus scanning.<p/>


<strong>workdir</strong><p/>
syntax: workdir=<i>string</i><br/>
default: /opt/av/tmp<p/>

The workdir directive defines the working directory where clapf will put its temporary
files. It must be writable to the user running clapf (usually "av").<p/>


<strong>queuedir</strong><p/>
syntax: queuedir=<i>string</i><br/>
default: none<p/>

The queuedir directive defines whether to keep queue files for later inspection
or for later training. If you enable this option by setting this variable (disabled by default)
do not forget to  keep an eye on this directory and periodically remove aged files (eg. with a
cron job). The workdir and the queuedir parameters must be on the same partition otherwise the
link() function will fail.<p/>


<strong>quarantine_dir</strong><p>
syntax: quarantine_dir=<i>string</i><br>
default: none<p>
The quarantine_dir directive defines the virus quarantine directory where clapf will put
virus infected messages. By default they are rejected and dropped.<p>


<strong>clapfemail</strong><p>
syntax: clapfemail=<i>email address</i><br>
default: none<p>
The clapfemail directive defines the From: address of the notification sent about
every virus infected email to the postmaster. Please set the localpostmaster variable
too, if you want to enable these notifications. I don't recommend this feature since
virus infected messages usually contain fake email addresses.<p>


<strong>localpostmaster</strong><p/>
syntax: localpostmaster=<i>email address</i><br/>
default: none<p/>

The localpostmaster directive defines the To: address of the notification sent about
every virus infected email to the postmaster. Please set the clapfemail variable
too, if you want to enable these notifications. I don't recommend this feature since
virus infected messages usually contain fake email addresses.<p>


<strong>silently_discard_infected_email</strong><p/>
syntax: silently_discard_infected_email=<i>0|1</i><br/>
default: 1<p/>

The silently_discard_infected_email directive defines whether to return 550 error
code and let the virus infected message be bounced back (0), or send back a 250 ok
code and drop the infected email (1).<p/>


<strong>dha_trap_address_list</strong><p/>
syntax: dha_trap_address_list=<i>comma separated email addresses</i><br/>
default: none<p/>

The dha_trap_address_list directive allows you to catch some DHA attacks by
specifying trap email addresses. If the attacker hits these addresses his
IP-address is recorded and his messages are treated as spam.<p/>

You have to enable the XFORWARD extension in postfix for this to work.<p/>

<h3>antispam stuff</h3>


<strong>use_antispam</strong><p>
syntax: use_antispam=<i>0|1</i><br>
default: 1<p>
The use_antispam directive defines whether to enable the anti-spam decision mechanism (1) or not (0).
Don't care about this if you have not compiled anti-spam support.<p>


<strong>tokensfile</strong><p>
syntax: tokensfile=<i>string</i><br>
default: /opt/av/tokens.cdb<p>
The tokensfile directive defines the path of the token spamicity dictionary.<p>


<strong>raw_text_datafile</strong><p>
syntax: raw_text_datafile=<i>string</i><p>
default: /opt/av/tokens.raw<p>
The raw_text_datafile directive defines the path of the raw token spamicity dictionary.
It is available only if you have used the --enable-hash-db while configuring and then
it is used instead the CDB database. Expect a few extra MBs memory per process while
using this feature.<p>


<strong>use_pairs</strong><p>
syntax: use_pairs=<i>0|1</i><br>
default: 1<p>
The use_pairs directive defines whether to use token pairs (1) or not (0) in the spamicity calculation.
I recommend you to enable this feature.<p>


<strong>use_single_tokens</strong><p>
syntax: use_single_tokens=<i>0|1</i><br>
default: 1<p>
The use_single_tokens directive defines whether to use single tokens (1) or not (0) in the spamicity calculation.
Single tokens are used only if we are not sure the result came from the token phrases. I recommend you to enable
this feature.<p>


<strong>min_phrase_number</strong><p>
syntax: min_phrase_number=<i>number</i><br>
default: 20<p>
The min_phrase_number directive defines the minimum number of known phrases (token pairs) that can
be used in the spamicity calculation without the single tokens. This should be set because we can have a greater
belief in phrases than single words. Set to 0 to disable this feature.<p>


<strong>esf_h</strong><p>
syntax: esf_h=<i>number</i><br>
default: 1<p>
The esf_h and esf_s directives define the 'effective size factor' (esf) parameters used to handle the redundacncy
of the overlapping tokens. esf_h applies to the redundancy of ham, and esf_s applies to the redundancy of spam.
Different values can be applied to esf_h and esf_s. I recommend you to test what values are good for you or you may
set both esf_h and esf_s to 1 if you want to disable this feature (default). Please also note that the current clapf
implementation does <i>not</i> use overlapping tokens.<p>


<strong>esf_s</strong><p>
syntax: esf_s=<i>number</i><br>
default: 1<p>
Look at the explanation at esf_h.<p>


<strong>exclusion_radius</strong><p/>
syntax: exclusion_radius=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 0.1<p/>

The exclusion_radius directive defines a radius from the neutral 0.5 probability. The
Spambayes and Bogofilter teams have pointed out that excluding the probabilities near
0.5 is useful. You may get rid of the neutral tokens within the exclusion radius.
The default value (0.1) means that probabilities between 0.4-0.6 are excluded.<p/>


<strong>max_message_size_to_filter</strong><p>
syntax: max_message_size_to_filter=<i>number</i><br>
default: 0<p>
The max_message_size_to_filter directive defines the maximum size of a message (in bytes) the spam filter is willing
to analyse. Messages larger than this value are skipped by the spamicity calculator. The default value (0) means no
such a limit.<p>


<strong>penalize_images</strong><p>
syntax: penalize_images=<i>number</i><br>
default: 0<p>

The penalize_images directive defines whether to penalize the email conataining images (1) or not (0).
It may help you to fight image based spam. If set and finds an image, a special spammy token is created
(IMAGE*) thus increasing the spam probability. Only one IMAGE* token is created even if the message has
multiple images.<p>


<strong>penalize_embed_images</strong><p>
syntax: penalize_embed_images=<i>number</i><br>
default: 0<p>

The penalize_embed_images directive defines whether to add an additional penalty to emails having embedded images (1)
or not (0). Embedded images has the src=cid:xxxxx sequence and pointing to the attached image. If set and finds an
embedded image, a special spammy token is created (EMBED*) thus increasing the spam probability. Only one EMBED*
token is created even if the message has multiple embedded images.<p>


<strong>penalize_octet_stream</strong><p/>
syntax: penalize_octet_stream=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 0<p/>

The penalize_octet_stream directive behaves exactly the same way as <i>penalize_images</i> directive except this
applies to binary or PDF attachments. It may help you to fight PDF based spam. If you want to enable it, set its
value to 1.<p/>



<strong>surbl_domain</strong><p>
syntax: surbl_domain=<i>string</i><br/>
default: multi.surbl.org<p/>

Name of the SURBL domain to use. Only valid if clapf was compiled with surbl support. Surbl is a kind of
RBL list. You may check every URI in your incoming email against the SURBL database.<p>

Clapf takes the last two part of the domain name, eg. aaaa.acts.hu -&gt; acts.hu joined with the <strong>surbl_domain</strong>
variable: acts.hu.multi.surbl.org.<br/> Dotted IP-addresses will be reversed: http://1.2.3.4/ -&gt; 4.3.2.1.multi.surbl.org.<p/>

If a positive match is found clapf adds a special spammy token thus the overall spamicity will be higher and possibly reach the spam
limit. See <a href="http://www.surbl.org/">http://www.surbl.org/</a> for more details about the SURBL system or
<a href="http://www.uribl.com/index.shtml">http://www.uribl.com/index.shtml</a> about uribl.<p/>

Of course you may set up your own rbl domain to check URLs against it and query multiply RBL lists with a comma separated
list of domains, eg. <i>surbl_domain=multi.surbl.org,multi.uribl.com,uris.yourdomain.name.here</i>.<p/>

If you want to disable the URI checks, unset this variable, eg. <i>surbl_domain=</i><p/>

<strong>rude_surbl</strong><p/>
syntax: rude_surbl=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 0<p/>

The rude_surbl directive defines the value of the bad URL threshold. Clapf counts how many URLs the surbl
code catches in the current message. Each match in the surbl domain(s) counts. So if you have a bad URL
and you have 2 surbl domains and this bad URL is on both surbl domains then it takes 2.<p/>

If this value is set (&gt;0) AND clapf gets at least this number of URL matches than this AND the spamicity
of the message is greater than max_ham_spamicity than the message is marked as spam.<p/>


<strong>rbl_domain</strong><p>
syntax: rbl_domain=<i>string</i><br>
default: none<p/>

The rbl_domain directive defines a list of comma separated RBL domains to use. If clapf is unable to determine
whether the message is ham or spam (=unsure), it will query the given RBL lists. If the sending host is found
on them, it will mark the message as spam.<p/>



<strong>clapf_header_field</strong><p>
syntax: clapf_header_field=<i>string</i><br>
default: X-Clapf-spamicity: <p>

The clapf_header_field directive defines the name of the custom header field clapf inserts to the message.
Please note that this value has to end with a space. I recommend you to set this variable to a custom
value.<p>


<strong>clapf_spam_header_field</strong><p>
syntax: clapf_spam_header_field=<i>string</i><br>
default: none<p>

The clapf_spam_header_field directive defines one or more additional header fields clapf inserts
into spam. You should set at least one line to let mailer applications recognise spam:<p>

<pre>
clapf_spam_header_field=X-Clapf-spamicity: Yes
</pre>

If your users use  some "less advanced" mailer applications (like Outlook Express)
that cannot use an arbitrary header field to filter messages you would add additional header
lines to help them. It's format is<p>

<pre>
<i>header name</i>: <i>value</i>
</pre>

You might use the following with OE:<p>

<pre>
clapf_spam_header_field=X-Priority: 5
clapf_spam_header_field=Priority: Non-Urgent
clapf_spam_header_field=Importance: low
clapf_spam_header_field=X-MSMail-Priority: Low
</pre>

For more information, see <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/OeFilter">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/OeFilter</a><p>


<strong>spam_subject_prefix</strong><p/>
syntax: spam_overall_limit=<i>string</i><br/>
default: none<p/>

The spam_subject_prefix directive defines the value of the prefix to be inserted to the beginning of
the "Subject: " line. You may put an arbitrary string here. "[SPAM] " or "[spam] " would be a wise
chioce (without the quotes). Please not that this field should contain a trailing space.<p/>


<strong>spam_overall_limit</strong><p/>
syntax: spam_overall_limit=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 0.92<p/>
The spam_overall_limit directive defines the spamicity limit. The message is marked as spam if
its overall probability is above this limit. It can be anywhere around (above) 0.9. If your
ham-spam data is good your spamicity values are expected around 0.001 and 0.999.
You may try even as low as 0.9.<p/>


<strong>max_ham_spamicity</strong><p/>
syntax: max_ham_spamicity=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 0.39<p/>

The max_ham_spamicity directive defines the maximum spam probability of a ham message.
It should be considered as a cut off value, lower value of the 'unsure' zone.<p/>


<strong>spaminess_oblivion_limit</strong><p/>
syntax: spaminess_oblivion_limit=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 1.01<p/>

The spaminess_oblivion_limit directive defines a threshold value. If the
spamicity of the message exceeds this threshold clapf will reject the message.
The default value is greater than 1, so clapf will _not_ drop spam by default.
If you set it to a lower value (eg. 0.99) clapf will reject emails with spamicity
at least 0.99 (>=99% probability of spam).<p/>

This feature can be useful on smtp relays where you want to eliminate _outgoing_ spam.
I do not recommend to use it on your incoming MX hosts as it may result losing a legitimate
email (though very rarely).<p/>


<strong>use_single_tokens_min_limit</strong><p>
syntax: use_single_tokens_min_limit=<i>number</i><br>
default: 0.85<p>

Some emails have a spamicity value around 0.5, so we know nothing sure about it and a few spams
are just below the spam_overall_limit. In this case we may calculate a spamicity value from the
single token table too. Then let's compare their deviation and choose the one with the greater
deviation. The use_single_tokens_min_limit and the min_deviation_to_use_single_tokens variables
determine in what cases to apply this behaviour. If the spamicity value is around
0.5 (+/- min_deviation_to_use_single_tokens) or the spamicity is between use_single_tokens_min_limit
and spam_overall_limit.<p>
If you want to disable this behaviour set the following:<br>
<pre>
use_single_tokens_min_limit=1
min_deviation_to_use_single_tokens=0
</pre>
<p>


<strong>min_deviation_to_use_single_tokens</strong><p>
syntax: min_deviation_to_use_single_tokens=<i>number</i><br>
default: 0.1<p>
Look at the explanation of use_single_tokens_min_limit above.<p>


<strong>spaminess_of_strange_language_stuff</strong><p>
syntax: spaminess_of_strange_language_stuff=<i>number</i><br>
default: 0.9876<p>
The spaminess_of_strange_language_stuff directive defines what spamicity score is assigned to messages
having too much strange language characters.<p>


<strong>spaminess_of_too_much_spam_in_top15</strong><p>
syntax: spaminess_of_too_much_spam_in_top15=<i>number</i><br>
default: 0.9998<p>
The spaminess_of_too_much_spam_in_top15 directive defines what spamicity score is assigned to messages
having too much spam in the top10 tokens.<p>


<strong>spaminess_of_blackholed_mail</strong><p>
syntax: spaminess_of_blackholed_mail=<i>number</i><br>
default: 0.9995<p>
The spaminess_of_blackholed_mail directive defines what spamicity score is assigned to messages
having the sender's IP-address in the blackhole database.<p>


<strong>spaminess_of_text_and_base64</strong><p>
syntax: spaminess_of_text_and_base64=<i>number</i><br>
default: 0.9996<p>
The spaminess_of_text_and_base64 directive defines what spamicity score is assigned to messages
having base64 encoded textual parts, regardless of their actual spamicity score.
Set to 0 to disable this feature.<p>


<strong>use_all_the_most_interesting_tokens</strong><p>
syntax: use_all_the_most_interesting_tokens=<i>0|1</i><br>
default: 1<p>
The use_all_the_most_interesting_tokens directive defines whether to use (1) or not (0) all
the most interesting tokens if we have more than MAX_SAMPLES_TO_CHOOSE.<p>


<strong>spam_ratio_in_top10</strong><p/>
syntax: spam_ratio_in_top10=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 0.9<p/>
The spam_ratio_in_top10 directive defines the maximum ratio of the spammy / all the tokens
in the top10. If it exceeds this limit the message is marked as spam. This is useful
to catch such a spam containing a lot of spam tokens as well as a few ham tokens
thus the overall spamicity score is not high enough to mark the whole message as spam.
Set to 0 to disable this feature.<p/>


<strong>blackhole_path</strong><p/>
syntax: blackhole_path=<i>string</i><br/>
default: none<p/>
The blackhole_path directive defines the path of the blackhole directory holding "blackholed"
IP addresses. If unset the blackhole feature is disabled.<p/>


<strong>training_mode</strong><p/>
syntax: training_mode=<i>0|1</i><br/>
default: 0<p/>

The training_mode directive defines the training mode that can be either
Train On Error (0) or Train Until Mature (1).
Users may train the token database (only) when an error occurs (=TOE). With
TUM mode, however, clapf will automatically trains those tokens not mature
enough (ie. having less then 50 hits in the token table). Though TUM has
a shorter learning curve, but it produces more tokens in the database, so
it will be larger than with TOE.<p/>


<strong>group_type</strong><p/>
syntax: group_type=<i>0|1</i><br/>
default: 1<p/>

The group_type directive defines the type of the token database.
This group may be either shared (0) or merged (1). A shared group is useful
when all the users have similar email patterns. A merged group consists
of a global database (with uid=0) and all users may train the token database
with their own data. Clapf will then merge these two datasets for the user
at run time. You may achieve greater accuracy while personal data requires
more space.<p/>


<strong>store_metadata</strong><p/>
syntax: store_metadata=<i>0|1</i><br/>
default: 1<p/>

The store_metadata directive defines whether to store the email with some
metadata to the database (1) or not (0). By default we store the email for
later training.<p/>



<h3>foreign language stuff</h3>

<strong>invalid_junk_limit</strong><p>
syntax: invalid_junk_limit=<i>string</i><br>
default: 5<p>
The invalid_junk_limit directive defines the maximum number of invalid characters (look ijc.h)
that the message may contain, otherwise it is marked as spam. Set to 0 to disable this feature.<p>


<strong>invalid_junk_line</strong><p>
syntax: invalid_junk_line=<i>number</i><br>
default: 1<p>
The invalid_junk_line directive defines the number of lines in a strange language if it is reached
the message is marked as spam. In other words if you set this variable to 1 and you get a message
with 1 line of strange language the message is marked as spam. Set to 0 to disable this feature.<p>


<strong>invalid_hex_junk_limit</strong><p>
syntax: invalid_hex_junk_limit=<i>string</i><br>
default: 40<p>
The invalid_hex_junk_limit directive defines the maximum number of invalid hexa characters (=xx)
that the message may contain, otherwise it is marked as spam. Set to 0 to disable this feature.<p>




<h3>libclamav stuff</h3>

syntax: use_libclamav_block_max_feature=<i>0|1</i><br/>
default: 1<p/>

The use_libclamav_block_max_feature directive defines whether to mark archives as viruses (1) or not (0)
if the clamav_maxfile, clamav_max_archived_file_size, clamav_max_recursion_level limit is reached.<p/>


<strong>clamav_maxfile</strong><p/>
syntax: clamav_maxfile=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 100<p/>

The clamav_maxfile directive defines the maximum number of the files in an archive. If the archive
contains more files than this limit libclamav will not scan it.<p/>


<strong>clamav_max_archived_file_size</strong><p/>
syntax: clamav_max_archived_file_size=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 31457280<p/>

The clamav_max_archived_file_size directive defines the maximum size of the uncompressed archive file (in bytes)
libclamav willing to scan.<p/>


<strong>clamav_max_recursion_level</strong><p/>
syntax: clamav_max_recursion_level=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 5<p/>

The clamav_max_recursion_level directive defines how many levels of recursion of the archive files
libclamav willing to scan.<p/>


<strong>clamav_max_compress_ratio</strong><p/>
syntax: clamav_max_compress_ratio=<i>number</i><br/>
default: 200<p/>

The clamav_max_compress_ratio directive defines the maximum compress ratio of the archive files libclamav
willing to scan.<p/>


<strong>clamav_archive_mem_limit</strong><p/>
syntax: clamav_archive_mem_limit=<i>0|1</i><br/>
default: 0<p/>

The clamav_archive_mem_limit directive defines whether to enable (1) or not (0) a memory limit for the bzip2 scanner.<p/>

<strong>clamav_block_encrypted_archives</strong><p/>
syntax: clamav_block_encrypted_archives=<i>0|1</i><br/>
default: 1<p/>

The clamav_block_encrypted_archives directive defines whether to mark encrypted archives as viruses (1) or not (0).<p/>


<h3>MySQL stuff</h3>
