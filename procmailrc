# Clapf sample procmailrc
# ==============================

# The following line should only be uncommented if you use a system-wide 
# /etc/procmailrc.
# See procmailrc(5) for infos on what it exactly does, the short version:
#  * The folders the mail is filed to later on is owned by the user, not
#    root.
# Leave it uncommented if you use .procmailrc
#DROPPRIVS=yes

# Pipe the mail through spamdrop.
#
# The condition line ensures that only messages smaller than 128 kB
# (128 * 1024 = 131072 bytes) are processed by spamdrop.
#
# The lock file ensures that only 1 spamdrop invocation happens
# at 1 time, to keep the load down.

# Work around procmail bug: any output on stderr will cause the "F" in "From"
# to be dropped.  This will re-add it.
# NOTE: This is probably NOT needed in recent versions of procmail
