0.4.4-rc2:

2010.02.07, SJ

Fixed a webui bug in login/login showing you the 'You are'
message as twice if you are actually logged in.
(webui/view/theme/default/templates/login/login.tpl)

Let the MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH variable be honored by common/home.php.
(webui/controller/common/home.php)

Users' quarantine defaults to show the spam emails. Of course
they can set to see all messages, or only the hams.
(webui/controller/login/login.php)

Let a wait cursor be displayed while the history is loading.
(webui/view/theme/default/templates/common/layout-history.tpl)

If the message to be trained is not in the per user quarantine
directory, then it tries the "archived" directory in his quarantine.
(spam.c)

2010.02.05, SJ

spamdrop.c fixes.
(credits: Gabor Varadi)
(spamdrop.c)

Fixed the user preferences issue. Now the webui stores the
user preferences in a SQLite3 based session database. Make
sure to give write access to both the sessions directory
and the sessions.sdb file.
(webui/*)

Let the quarantine remember what search terms you have set
while delivering, removing, training, etc. messages.
(webui/*)


2010.02.04, SJ

spamdrop_helper.c changes.
(credits: Gabor Varadi)
(contrib/spamdrop_helper/spamdrop_helper.c)

spamdrop enhancements.
(credits: Gabor Varadi)
(spamdrop.c)

Reverted the webui training changes, because the webui removed
the message before postfix handed it to clapf to learn, so clapf
produced an "invalid signature" (or similar) error message.
(webui/controller/quarantine/*train.php)

2010.02.03, SJ

Let the webui forward training requests to postfix instead of clapf.
(webui/controller/quarantine/*train.php, webui/setup/setup.php)

Simplified quarantine list page.
(webui/*)

2010.02.01, SJ

Fixed the display of the page length at route=common/home. It
also uses sessions instead of cookies.
(webui/*)

Let the config parser syslog if an unknown key was found, otherwise
it will interfere with the output of spamdrop.
(cfg.c)

Added a procmailrc script, you may try it if you don't like maildrop.
(credits: Tamas Papp)
(procmailrc)

Fixed a webui bug preventing the administrators to set a password
shorter than 8 characters.
(webui/controller/user/edit.php)

Fixed another webui bug, and let the values of a new policy be the
same as the clapf.conf defaults.
(webui/controller/policy/add.php)

Modified the logout() function, and it won't destroy all the sessions,
only unsets the username and admin_user variables. Thus the other session
related settings (language and pagelen) may survive the logout as
long as the session is alive.
(webui/system/misc.php)

2010.01.28, SJ

Added a history purge script, and fixed the ubuntu init script.
(credits: Tamas Papp)
(history/history/history-purge-*sql, init.d/clapf.ubuntu.in)

Enhanced the webui to able to show you even the ham messages,
and allows you to train the false negatives (ie. missed spam
emails).
(webui/*)

Changed the default path of the pidfile to /var/run/clapf.
(config.h, Makefile.in)

Added the history specific config variables to example.conf
(example.conf)

2010.01.26, SJ

Added the Ubuntu and Redhat specific clapf init scripts, and
let the make process set the PREFIX in them.
(init.d/*)

You can set/redefine the webui language on the fly.
(webui/*)


0.4.4-rc1:


2010.01.25, SJ

Modified the webui to be compatible with PHP 5.3.1. You have to either run the
setup utility or replace "sqlite3" to "sqlite" in your config.php.
(webui/*)

2010.01.21, SJ

Modified the clapf daemon to user the 'username' config file
variable instead specifying -u and -g to set the uid and gid.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, clapf.c, errmsg.h, config.h)

2010.01.20, SJ

maillog.pl enhancements.
(history/maillog.pl, cfg.c, cfg.h)

2010.01.18, SJ

Webui enhancements.
(webui/*)

Fixed a to= and orig_to= parsing issue.
(history/maillog.pl)

2010.01.15, SJ

Fixed a locale bug in parsembox.c causing to miss accented characters.
(parsembox.c)

2010.01.14, SJ

Modified the Makefile to let other than gnu make be able to compile clapf.
(Notably on Solaris and FreeBSD)
(Makefile.in, contrib/spamsum/Makefile.in, contrib/spamdrop_helper/Makefile.in, configure*)

2010.01.13, SJ

Fixed a bug in the webui prevented the admin users to remove a spam from
a user's quarantine, and forced admin user to leave the user's quarantine
after the unsuccesful removal.
(webui/controller/quarantine/remove.php)

Fixed a bug in the maillog.pl script missing the domain part of the 'to='
addresses having '=' sign (usually list addresses).
(history/maillog.pl)

2010.01.12, SJ

Modified the history schema and the collecting perl script to gain a
performance boost.
(history/*, webui/controller/history/worker.php)

2010.01.11, SJ

Added a new variable 'queuedir' to let you define its path to your will.
(cfg.h, cfg.c, config.h, Makefile.in, example.conf)

2010.01.10, SJ

Added a search/filter feature to the webui history. It requires to
accept cookies. You are allowed to set filter criteria at the 0th page,
ie. page=0.
Whenever you set a filter term it will be used at the next AJAX request,
ie. expect a ~5 sec delay.
(webui/*)

Added an escaping to the sender and recipient domains.
(webui/controller/history/worker.php)


0.4.3.1:


2010.01.06, SJ

If you have specified the '-r' switch for spamdrop, then it tried to
query the database even before it was opened, and it produced a segmentation
fault. Fixed.
(spamdrop.c)

2010.01.03, SJ

Fixed the maillog.pl script to skip lines if they do not have a valid to field.
(history/maillog.pl)

Webui setup fixes.
(webui/setup/setup.tpl)

2010.01.02, SJ

Now the webui handles different history databases.
(webui/index.php, webui/controller/history/worker.php)

Fixed an URL related parser bug introduced in translate2().
(misc.c)

2009.12.30, SJ

spamdrop is now setuid, so we can always enter the workdir, even if we
just test a single message with spamdrop -D
(spamdrop.c, Makefile.in)

Older sqlite3 versions (eg. 3.3.x) do not have the -batch command line options.
The configure script checks for the presence of the -batch option.
(Makefile.in, configure*)

libclapf.so* link fixes.
(Makefile.in)

2009.12.29, SJ

Updated the stat/process_syslog.pl script to match the current logging style.
(stat/process_syslog.pl)

2009.12.28, SJ

Created the contrib/spamdrop_helper directory with
Varadi Gabor's spamdrop_helper.c
(contrib/spamdrop_helper)

Fixed the blackhole routine.
(black.c)

Added a mysql version of history.
(webui/setup/*, webui/controller/history/worker.php)

Simplified the statistics.
(stat/clapf-stat.run.sh)

Added a fix to the configure script to include the spam.o and antispam.o
object files if using --enable-spamc-emul
(configure*)


0.4.3:

2009.12.21, SJ

Parser fix.
(misc.c)

Various spamdrop fixes.
(spamdrop.c)

2009.12.19, SJ

Spamdrop fix.
(spamdrop.c)

(credits: Gabor Varadi)

2009.12.18, SJ

A few users complained about the merge of the spam status and the
probability value. So reverted the change, but you can use the '-o'
command line switch for this compact behaviour.
(spamdrop.c)


0.4.3-rc2:


2009.12.17, SJ

Modified the clapf_admin.sh script to handle sqlite3 databases, too.
(Makefile.in, util/clapf_admin-sql.sh.in)

2009.12.16, SJ

The spamdrop utility removes the clapf related header lines from the header only.

It's also possible to suppress all normal syslog activity (except for errors)
if using the '-q' command line switch or specifying verbose=0 in the config file.

Changed spamdrop to print the spam status and the spaminess probability in a single
row, eg. 'X-Clapf-spamicity: Yes, 1.000' or 'X-Clapf-spamicity: No, 0.0001'.
(spamdrop.c)

2009.12.15, SJ

Minor fixes for various parts of clapf.
(cfg.c, config.h, Makefile.in, spamdrop.c, util/db_init.sh, util/purge-sqlite3.sh, util/spamdrop_helper.in)

(credits: Gabor Varadi and Christoph Wilke)

2009.12.11, SJ

Add an extra '${clapf_header_field} statistically whitelisted' header
if the message is statistically whitelisted.
(defs.h, session.c, spamdrop.c, bayes.c, antispam.c)

2009.12.10, SJ

Christoph Wilke contributed some fixes related to the spamsum module. Thanks!
(contrib/spamsum/ssum.c, contrib/spamsum/Makefile.in)

(credits: Christoph Wilke)

2009.12.02, SJ

Added an init script.
(Makefile.in, init.d/clapf.in)

Splitted the util/db_init_* scripts to util/db_init.sh for the
creation of the database schema, and util/db_train.sh for training
from scratch. I have also unified the training scripts, so you have
to specify the database type as well (ie. either sqlite3 or mysql).

2009.12.01, SJ

Enhanced the maillog.pl utility to be able to handle either sqlite3
or mysql database.

Usage examples: maillog
maillog.pl -l /var/log/maillog --db sqlite3 --database /var/lib/clapf/log.sdb
maillog.pl -l /var/log/maillog --db mysql --database history --user history --password veryhardsecret

(history/maillog.pl)

2009.11.27, SJ

Added a utility called zombitest. It's purpose is to test whether
a given host matches the zombienet.regex file. Usage: eg.

zombietest mail-gx0-f212.google.com triband-mum-59.184.161.130.mtnl.net.in

If you need this utility then issue a "make zombitest"
(zombietest.c)

2009.11.11, SJ

Fixed a nasty bug in smtp.c. If clapf gets an email from another
clapf, then it fails to remove the last line of the foreign clapf
instance causing evaluation problems. The bug was introduced with
0.4.3-rc1, so previous versions are believed not affected.
(smtp.c)

2009.11.09, SJ

Added a new utility (clapfconf) to show configuration variables, just
as the postconf utility does.
(clapfconf.c)

2009.11.08, SJ

Code cleanup. Created a brand new config file parsing utility.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, clapf.h, clapf.c, parsembox.c, misc.c, misc.h, hash2.c,
config.h, avir.c, example.conf, spamstat.c, Makefile.in, clapfconf.c)
(credits: turul16)

2009.11.06, SJ

Removed a bug prevented clapf to train messages in multiple rounds iteratively.
(bayes.c)

2009.11.05, SJ

If the messages is evaluated as a possible spam, we can put a
special header field too. By default the followinf field is set:
clapf_possible_spam_header_field=X-Clapf-spamicity: maybe
(antispam.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)
(credits: tompos)

Removed the unnecessary t_queue table reference from the purge scripts.
(util/purge*)


0.4.3-rc1:


2009.11.03, SJ

Add a [spam???] prefix to the Subject: line if the message probability
is greater than possible_spam_limit (0.8 by default) and less than
spam_overall_limit (0.92 by default).
(smtp.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)

2009.11.02, SJ

Code cleanup.
(cfg.c, config.h)

2009.10.29, SJ

Added a 32kB mail buffer to skip reading the temp file for
parsing and handing back to postfix. clapf performance gained
only 0.6-2.1% in my tests so this code is not compiled by default.
If you need this extra performance, then add '-DHAVE_MAILBUF' to
the 'DEFS' line of the Makefile, and recompile clapf.
(defs.h, parser.c, parser.h, smtp.c, session.c)

Fixed a configure script bug searching for the tre.h header file.
(configure*)

2009.10.27, SJ

Replaced all signal() calls with sig_action().
(clapf.c, session.c, sig.c, sig.h)

2009.10.26, SJ

Added a strcasestr() compatible function in case of the target system
has no _GNU_SOURCE in the header files.
(misc.c, misc.h)

2009.10.22, SJ

Reset the alarm clock after processing a message. Thus a child process
does not have to be killed by a forced exit after the default 420 secs.
(session.c)

2009.10.21, SJ

The webui will keep the entered data in case of a user add failure
to save you typing user data again (except the password fields).
(webui/controller/user/add.php, webui/view/theme/default/templates/user/add.tpl)

2009.10.19, SJ

clapf syslog()'s the number of rounds it used for training
a message.
(bayes.c, spam.c)

2009.10.16, SJ

Added a new counter to the 'delays=' to show how much
time clapf needs to acquire a message from postfix.
(session.c, defs.h)

2009.10.05, SJ

Added lmtp support to history/maillog.pl
(history/maillog.pl)

Changed the size of acceptbuf 8192->512 bytes, and a single
RCPT TO: line should fit in 256 bytes otherwise clapf sends
an 550 too long recipient message back.
(session.c, defs.h, spam.c)

Modified clapf to extract tokens from the training message only,
and discard the stored message itself. This change has obsoleted
the --enable-outlook-hack configure option, since clapf searches
the Received: lines for valid clapf ids.
(spam.c, misc.c, parser.c, webui/controller/quarantine/*train.php)

2009.10.04, SJ

Moved the antispam part from session.c to antispam.c, and
additional code cleanup.
(session.c, antispam.c, defs.h, clapf.h)

2009.10.02, SJ

Minor webui fixes.
(webui/*)

TRE includes fixes.
(defs.h)

More locale fixes. If you use a policy settings, then the previous setlocale
bug came again. Now I set only LC_MESSAGES and LC_CTYPE according to the
current locale settings clapf.conf.
(clapf.c, spamdrop.c)

MySQL optimisations.
(credist: cydrk)

(session.c)

Skip the faked 'Received: ' line if found in the header.
(smtp.c)

If the tre library matches a zombie host, then a special spammy
token is instantiated.
(hash2.c)


2009.09.27, SJ

Most spam emails come from zombie networks where the infected
hosts send the email directly instead of using their service
providers smtp servers. Postfix can be set to pass the XFORWARD
info that clapf can use.

I have compiled a regex file (zombienets.regex) to list/match
most of them, eg. c-98-214-27-79.hsd1.il.comcast.net. Many of
the zombies has no (valid) PTR record, so you may append the
word 'unknown' to match them.

Currently I run this test to see how it performs. Later I will
add a configuration variable allows you to mark these emails
immediately as spam. Alternatively you can configure postfix
to reject messages coming from directly end user computers.

To enable this feature, install the TRE library, and copy
zombienets.regex to /usr/local/share/clapf

Finally set 'message_from_a_zombie' variable to decide what to
do with messages from zombies. See example.conf for help. The
default action is let is pass and let the antispam engine
handle it.

(clapf.c, defs.h, session.c, session.h, zombienets.regex, configure*, config.h, clapf-config.h.in)

2009.09.26, SJ

Revised the queue file storage to let the clapf daemon
support store-less training.

If you set store_metadata=1, then clapf will store the
metadata needed for training. In case of store_metadata=0
clapf will store nothing, and you cannot train it by
forwarding emails to spam@ or ham@.

So with store_metadata=1 clapf is able to train messages
even if the original message itself does not exists in
the queue directory.

If you omit the --with-store=... configure option, then
clapf writes an empty file acting as an identifier used
for training, no matter what store_only_spam is.

If you do specify the --with-store=... option, then clapf
saves the message itself, suitable for viewing the quarantine
as well. If you set store_only_spam=1, then clapf stores
the spam messages only, and writes an empty file for the
good emails.

(smtp.c, parser.c, spam.c, session.c, clapf.h, defs.h)

2009.09.25, SJ

Added the store_only_spam config variable to the policy.
(db-*sql, ldap/clapf-policy.schema, policy.c, webui/*)

2009.09.23, SJ

clapf emits the "child exited" syslog message only in debug mode.
(session.c)

Added the memcached stuff to the source tree.
(memcached_cleaner.c, mysql.c)

Added a default setlocale() call before (re)loading the configuration.
Let's you have set locale=hu_HU. clapf starts, and reads variables as
the default locale value (probably) en_US. Then later you change the
configuration and send a HUP signal to let clapf re-read its config.
It will, however with the current (hu_HU) locality. Thus all your float
variables are toasted if you have written them as 0.92 (and not 0,92).

To prevent nasty things to happen I included a setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US")
system call before any configuration read.

Workaround: stop and start clapf after any configuration changes.
(clapf.c)

0.4.2:

2009.09.20, SJ

A few bugfixes causing clapf to crash on some x64 platforms.

(users.c, misc.c, session.c, black.c, spamdrop.c)

2009.09.18, SJ

The webui will write the correct error message in case of a short
password. Additionally you can specify the minimum password length
in config.php (MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH)
(webui/)

2009.09.17, SJ

Removed the CLAMAV_EXTRA_LIBS definition from Makefile.in. Earlier
--enable-libclamav installations needed if. Now it appears that we
are fine without it.

(Makefile.in)

0.4.2-rc1:

2009.09.11, SJ

Fixed a bug in the history prevented to show dropped emails
(ie. viruses).

Administrators can view the user's graphical statistics too.
(history/*, webui/)

2009.09.10, SJ

Modified the training routine to break after the first round
before the spaminess check in case of a TOE mode.
(bayes.c)

Removed the DHA stuff. The blackhole/minefield feature should take
care of it. The postfix will probably catch invalid recipients and
not letting the to clapf.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf, session.c)

Revised the blackhole/minefield feature. Since most of the hosts are
rather grey instead of being black or white, than marking a message
as spam merely on the base that it sent us spam to the trap address
is probably a bad idea. (Hint: shared websites)

So clapf will generate a special spammy token if the sender host is
on our minefield.

Also note that I have changed the way clapf stores the IP-addresses.
Scanning a large directory takes a considerable time so clapf will
put entries to a mysql table (t_minefield). Look at db-*sql, and be
sure to create it before upgrade.
(black.c, session.c, spamdrop.c)

2009.09.09, SJ

Removed the history/archive controller. The history/worker is smart
enough to do the job alone.
(webui/)

Added a feature to AD import: the webui import/query routine saves
the ldap connection info (except the ldap password) to the 't_remote'
table, and is able to recall it later. So you have to type the bind
password only.
(webui/)

2009.09.08, SJ

Added an errorstring if login has failed.
You can add multiple domains in the domain menu.
Give a correct error message if no entries in the history log
instead of an thrown php error.

(webui/)

2009.09.07, SJ

Added a check to import from Active Directory, and skip adding already
exsiting email addresses.
(webui/)

2009.09.06, SJ

Added a message history view to the webui. It supports sqlite3 backend
currently. To use it create a database according to the history/mail.sql
schema, then run the history/maillog.pl script that reads the maillog
and collects data available for the webui.

The maillog.pl script needs the File::Tail, Date::Parse abd DBD::SQLite3
moduls. You can get them from the CPAN site.
(history/*, webui)

2009.09.02, SJ

Simplified logging. clapf will syslog a single line if verbosity=1.
I have introduced a very extensive time measurement, so you can spot
bottlenecks. You can see how many seconds (sic!) takes to parse the
email, the statistical decision, updating the tokens, and inject back
to postfix. You will be surprised to see that handing the email back
to postfix takes the most time...
(avir.c, misc.c, session.c, spamdrop.c, smtp.c, stat/spamstat.pl, stat/process_syslog.pl)

Webui fixes.
(db-*sql, webui/*)

2009.08.31, SJ

Added policy support for sqlite3 too.
(policy.c)

2009.08.25, SJ

Changed the per user quarantine path splitting. The default is the
old one created by the username. However you can change to the new
uid splitting by the '--enable-uid-splitting' configure option. 

If you choose the new uid splitting be sure to select the the same
in the webui setup script.
(spam.c, clapf.h, spamdrop.c, example.conf, webui)

2009.08.24, SJ

Enhanced the webui to show the image(s) if the spam has any.
Please create a "cache/" directory under your webui, and let the web
server has write permissions on it. I recommend you to extend the quarantine
purge script to the cache directory to remove aged spam images.

The webui lets you to add email aliases too when adding a new user. You
don't have to add user then edit him to define additional email addresses.

You can also define the size attribute of the user section in the config.php.
Add the following two lines to your config.php (or rerun the setup script):

define('CGI_INPUT_FIELD_WIDTH', 50);
define('CGI_INPUT_FIELD_HEIGHT', 7);

Polished the HTML code to be more w3 standard friendly.
(webui/*)

Extract the .tld from the long hostnames in the "Received: from" lines.
(misc.c, misc.h, parser.c)

2009.08.21, SJ

Changed the way clapf organises the queue directory. Now we query the uid of the
given user, create a path like 10000/100/95/h|s.<message-id>, instead the old
method using j/jack.
If you have an existing install, just enable the enable_old_queue_compat variable
(disabled by default) in clapf.conf until all the per user queue files are purged
from the old directory structure (~7 days).
(spam.c, clapf.h, spamdrop.c, example.conf, webui)

2009.08.13, SJ

Force sdata.uid=0 if the message landed on the minefield (blackhole)
(spamdrop.c, session.c)


2009.08.05, SJ

Introduced a new configuration variable 'max_number_of_tokens_to_filter'.
Though some spams have a few words they may be bigger than 'max_message_size_to_filter'
due to their binary (pdf, mp3, gif, ...) attachment. I have introduced a new
configuration variable, 'max_number_of_tokens_to_filter', so clapf will still
check a message if its size is greater then 'max_message_size_to_filter' AND
has fewer tokens than 'max_number_of_tokens_to_filter'.

By default max_number_of_tokens_to_filter=2000.

(example.conf, cfg.c, cfg.h, session.c, spamdrop.c)

The parser create .tld domains as well, ie. URL*chinaspammer.cn, and URL*.cn, too.

(misc.c, misc.h, parser.c)


2009.08.03, SJ

Modified the user listing if using sql backend. Now the webui lists the users
in one instance even if they have multiply email addresses. You can view/edit
all the email addresses in the edit page in a textarea field.

Additionally improved the user search feature, the webui searches for the given
pattern in the usernames and email addresses.


2009.07.29, SJ

Fixed a few bugs in the ldap handling.

2009.07.27, SJ

Finished ldap support for the brand new webui.
(webui/*)

2009.07.24, SJ

Rewritten the whole webui using the model-view-controller (MVC) method.

The MVC method isolates business logic from the user interface,
permitting one to be freely modified without affecting the other. The
controller collects user input, the model manipulates application data,
and the view presents results to the user.

The new webui features an installer. Please note that the old config.php
is not compatible with the new webui, so run setup/setup.php.

Please note that the new webui support only the sqlite3 and the mysql
user db. The LDAP support is on the way.

If you are using sqlite3, then update the database schema (see db-sqlite3.sql)
and add the t_policy table.
(webui/*)

2009.06.30, SJ

Fixed an encoding bug caused improper view of iso-8859-2 messages

Modified the spamdrop utility to print most of its stuff to stdout instead of stderr.
(lots of *.c files)

2009.06.01, SJ

Put the add_penalties() function after the token
update function to prevent overwriting a special
token.
(parser.c, bayes.c, hash.c, hash.h)

2009.05.29, SJ

Modified the spamdrop utility to able to handle
virtual users, and provide the functionality of
the spamtest utility if using the -D command line
option, ie. 'spamdrop -D < message' or
'spamdrop -D -r jim@aaaa.fu < message'
(Makefile.in, maildroprc, spamdrop.c)

2009.05.27, SJ

Updated the libclamav related stuff due to change in the
clamav API.
(avir.c, clapf.c, clapf.h, session.c, session.h)




0.4.1-rc2:

2009.05.26, SJ

Modified the webui to display the formatted email. You can
see the raw email as an option in the menu.
(webui/q.php, webui/funcs.php, webui/lang/*)

2009.05.24, SJ

Removed the man pages. They were not up-to-date, and maintaining
docs at two places are draining.
(doc/ Makefile.in)

Changed the webui encoding to utf-8.
(webui/lang/hu/messages.php)

2009.05.22, SJ

The train_message() function also needed a similar fix.

2009.05.19, SJ

Webui fixes.
(webui/*)

2009.05.18, SJ

Added the '--enable-outlook-hack' configure option to workaround
the nasty habit of Outlook 12 (not Outlook Express).
(misc.c, smtop.c, configure*)

2009.05.17, SJ

Modified the database schema: introduced a new table storing
uid <-> email address relations for the MySQL and SQLite3 backend.
Please note that --with-userdb=ldap users are not affected.

Be sure to read the 0th point in the UPGRADE file!
(db-*.sql, util/db-update-*.sql, users.c, config.h, webui/.htdb.php, webui/lang/*, webui/*)

2009.05.14, SJ

Added clapf message id to the logging of the training part.
(bayes.c)

2009.05.12, SJ

Fixed a bug preventing the proper handling of users with uid=0.
(webui/mysql.php, webui/sqlite3.php, webui/users.php)

(webui/*)

2009.05.01, SJ

Users may change their passwords.
(webui/ldap.php, webui/mysql.php, webui/sqlite3.php, lang/*, webui/index.php)

2009.04.30, SJ

Added the password and 'isadmin' fields to the webui. From now
the .htpasswd authentication is no longer available. Webui passwords
are stored in the corresponding database or ldap directory.
(webui/ldap.php, webui/mysql.php, webui/sqlite3.php, webui/webui.php, ...)

2009.04.24, SJ

Added a password field to the sql schemas, and an extra
field (isadmin) to determine if the user is admin or not.
The webui is extended for these features.
(db-*sql, ldap/qmail.schema, ldap/example.ldif, webui/ldap.php)




0.4.1-rc1:

2009.04.22, SJ

The jpgraph library was huge, so I replaced it with libchart
http://naku.dohcrew.com/libchart/pages/introduction/.
(webui/libchart)

2009.04.21, SJ

Added a graphical representation of the per user statitics by
the JpGraph project (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/).
You need PHP 5.x for the 2.x series of JpGraph.
If you stuck with PHP4, then download the 1.x version
of JpGraph.
(webui/stat.php, webui/graph.php, webui/jpgraph)

Pipelining support for the smtp receiving side of clapf.
(smtpcodes.h)

2009.04.17, SJ

Modified boundary handling in the parser.
(configure*, Makefile.in, boundary.c, boundary.h, parser.c, defs.h)

2009.04.15, SJ

Added a command line utility called smtpscanner. It can be used
as a content filter for any MTA (eg. sendmail) as follows:

Configure two instances of your MTA. Instance "A" accepts messages
from the network, then passes to smtpscanner*. Smtpscanner then
passes the (perhaps) modified message to instance B on a port
like 10026.

Please note that if you are using postfix, then stick to the regular
"advanced content-filter" method, as it is more resource efficient.

Plase also note that smtpscanner should NOT be used with libclamav,
as loading the database into memory has an overhead, use clamd instead.

If you want to use the smtpscanner, then issue a "make smtpscanner" as
this utility does not compiles by default.

*: it is an interactive version of session.c. It reads data from stdin
and prints the answers to stdout.

(smtpscanner.c)

2009.04.14, SJ

Moved the parse_message() function to make less object
files if having only antivirus functionality.
(bayes.c, bayes.h, parser.c, parser.h, session.c)

2009.04.10, SJ

Fixed a bug in the language files.
(webui/lang/*)

2009.04.09, SJ

Added paging support to user list.
(webui/users.php, webui/mysql.php, webui/sqlite3.php, webui/ldap.php)

2009.04.02, SJ

Fixed a bug in spamdrop preventing to train a message bigger than
max_message_size_to_filter, and spamdrop can determine now correctly
your userid if you train from the command line.
(spamdrop.c)

2009.03.18, SJ

Fixed a bug causing incorrect sql statements if using the t_black_list
table.

(credits: efpe)
(users.c, session.c, spamdrop.c, clapf.h)

You can do bulk user editing. If you select some user ids in users.php
and click on the "Bulk edit selected uids" button, then you can set the
policy group, white- and blacklist for the selected uids.

You can remove the selected uids (and all of their email addresses) by
clicking on the "Remove selected uids" button.

(webui/massusers.php, webui/lang/*)

You can search between usernames and email addresse.
(webui/mysql.php, webui/users.php)

2009.03.16, SJ

Fixed a bug, now clapf handles properly such a pipelining
situation where an incomplete QUIT command follows the period
(.), ie.

# end of packet1:
  6f 70 65 72 6c 79 0d 0a    0d 0a 2e 0d 0a 51 55 49    operly.......QUI
#
# this is packet2:
T 127.0.0.1:45721 -> 127.0.0.1:10025 [AP]
  54 0d 0a                                              T..             

(session.c)

2009.03.12, SJ

Modified clapf to let a training request get through if we
cannot find the user it's intended to. This is the case if
you have to use an SMTP server running clapf, but the training
request should reach another SMTP server with clapf, ie.

user -> smtp1 -> smtp2

Now clapf will not swallow the training request, so it may
reach its next destination.
(session.c)

2009.03.10, SJ

Added an option to the webui to set the page length of the
quarantine. You can set it between 10 ... 100.
(webui/index.php, webui/q.php)

You can do mass training and delivery from the quarantine
with selecting the messages, then with a single click.
(webui/mass* webui/funcs.php, webui/lang/*)

Separated the HELO and the EHLO/LHLO answers. We return a
mere "250 Ok" if the SMTP client tells us "HELO".
(session.c)

2009.03.09, SJ

Enhanced a webui that if the given user has no entry in
the t_white_list or t_black_list table, then the set_whitelist()
and set_blacklist() functions create the necessary entries.

Updated the UPGRADE file, too.

(webui/mysql.php, UPGRADE)
(credits: epfe)


2009.03.07, SJ

Webui enhancements. The quarantine listing now tries
to decode the 'From:' and 'Subject:' fields to let
the users have a clue what is that message is about.

You can remove all your spam emails from the quarantine
with one click on the "Purge all messages from quarantine"
button.

(webui/funcs.php, webui/q.php)

2009.03.04, SJ

Even more bugfixing with the pipelining code.
(session.c)

2009.03.03, SJ

Fixed a bug on the receiving side of the pipelining code.
(session.c)

2009.03.02, SJ

It looks a bit better and neater if the spaminess buffer
is appended to the end of the header instead the beginning.

(smtp.c)

2009.03.01, SJ

Separated the header manipulation to the send_headers() function.
This produces a more readable smtp session handling code.

Modified the placement of the spaminess buffer. Now it sends
before the actual message, so you may find it right after the
last (ie. first) Received: lines.

(smtp.c, session.c)

2009.02.28, SJ

Added PIPELINING support when injecting the message back to
postfix. It works, but a little testing is required. So if
you do not want this behaviour, then replace EHLO with HELO
in smtp.c.

(smtp.c)

2009.02.27, SJ

Added an option to clapf.conf to enable conditional virus scanning
of the incoming emails. If you enable the always_scan_message
variable then clapf will send every email to the virus scanner.
This may help against phishing attacks, as clamav is able to
mark these scams as viruses.

However at a greater load, it may be better to spare the AV
scanner from textual only messages. So if you set always_scan_message=0
then clapf will send emails to the antivirus engine only if they
contain a base64 encoded part. This is the case when the message
contains a zip/exe/doc/pdf/... attachment. 

Changed the mysql database opening stuff to connect only once at
the start of the clapf child handling the SMTP session. Postfix
may keep a connection open for 300s, so it may be a good idea to
spare the mysql_real_connect() before processing a single SMTP
transaction. More tests follow to see how this setup handle the
restart and loss of the mysql server.

(session.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)


2009.02.24, SJ

Miklos has discovered two bugs:

Bug #1: a typo caused clapf not to put the spam_subject_prefix
value to the Subject line if the value was shorter than 22
characters.

Bug #2: the per user policy settings did not override the default
policy settings when it comes to decide whether to drop the spam
spam or not.

(session.c, smtp.c)

(credits: Miklos Toldi)


Changed the Makefile to install clapf to the ${prefix}/sbin
directory.

(Makefile.in)


2009.02.18, SJ

If you train with spamdrop from the command line, you may
use the FROM environment variable to train for a different
user, eg.

FROM=someother@email spamdrop -S < message

Alternatively you can use the -U command line parameter to
specify what clapf user-id to train.

Example 1: train a message for jack (assuming that his clapf user-id is 1007)

spamdrop -U 1007 -S < message

Example 2: train the global database

spamdrop -U 0 -S < message

(spamdrop.c)


2009.02.17, SJ

Removed the unused insert_2_queue() function.

(mysql.c, sqlite3.c)

2009.02.16, SJ

You can start clapf as root, and you can specify what uid and gid
you want clapf to run (after it binds to the given port).

(clapf.c)

Added an experimental spamd support. So if you want to replace
amavis with clapf you are good to go.
I recommend to use either the regular statistical anti-spam
module or the spamc emulation.

If you want to try how it performs, the use the --enable-spamc-emul
configure option, and set the spamd_addr, spamd_port and spamc_user
variables at the end of the clapf.conf file.

(cfg.c, cfg.h, session.c, spamc.c)

2009.02.16, SJ

Possible to use per domain specifications in the user
table. Let's say you want to give some specific settings
to the domain @aaaa.fu, but something special to user1@aaaa.fu.
Then setup user1@aaaa.fu, and instead entering every possible
other users in the @aaaa.fu domain, add only the @aaaa.fu
domain itself.

mysql>select * from user;

uid |   username   |   email       | policy_group |
----+--------------+---------------+--------------+
1001| user1        | user1@aaaa.fu |      14      |
1001| @aaaa.fu     | @aaaa.fu      |       0      |

....


(users.c)

2009.02.13, SJ

You can disable the update of the token timestamps by
setting update_tokens=0 in clapf.conf. This is useful
if you do not want to run the periodic purge script,
and you want to spare the UPDATE t_token .... SQL command.

If you are running the periodic purge script, leave
the default settings, ie. update_tokens=1

(cfg,c, cfg.h, session.c, spamdrop.c, example.conf)

2009.02.06, SJ

Added a blacklist functionality (similar to the whitelist). If
the sender is on the blacklist then clapf will syslog and discard
the message. Please note that the whitelist check takes precedence
and if you happen to put a sender to both the whitelist and the
blacklist, the email will get through.

If you need this feature, then create the following sql table:

--
create table if not exists t_black_list (
        uid int unsigned not null primary key,
        blacklist blob default null
);

create index t_black_list_idx on t_black_list (uid);
insert into t_black_list (uid) values(0);
--

If you are using ldap, then you may use the 'filterMember'
attribute to store the blacklisted email addresses.

(users.c, clapf.h, session.c, spamdrop.c, db-mysql.sql, db-sqlite3.sql)

2009.02.04, SJ

Revised the store concept. You can use the --with-store option
to specify where to store the emails for later retraining and
for spam quarantine.

If you omit this configure option, then clapf will not keep a
copy of the incoming emails. You may specify 'fs' (without
the quotes) to keep messages on the local filesystem, or
you may use 'mysql' if you prefer to keep them in the t_queue
mysql table.

If you are running clapf to filter spam on multiple machines,
this should be your choice.

Please note that the --enable-outgoing-smtp configure option
is deprecated. You may get the same effect if you don't use
the --with-store option.

(spam.c, session.c, spamdrop.c)

Modified the policy definition to store the store_metadata
variable.

(policy.c, webui/mysql.php, webui/ldap.php, webui/policy.php,
db-mysql.sql, ldap/clapf-policy.schema)

2009.02.03, SJ

Enhanced the spamdrop utility. The '-p' option is deprecated,
spamdrop prints the message by default. If you use the '-d'
option spamdrop will use the delivery_agent specified in clapf.conf
to deliver the given message.

So if you don't want to use the SMTP content-filter daemon, try
the following in master.cf:

spamdrop        unix - n n - - pipe
		user=clapf argv=/usr/local/bin/spamdrop -d
		-f ${sender} -r ${recipient}

Then add "-o content_filter=spamdrop" (without the quotes)
to the smtp service, eg.

smtp      inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
        -o content_filter=spamdrop


Additionally spamdrop can use several antivirus engines.

Please note that spamdrop will print the clapf related extra
headers to the beginning of the header.

(spamdrop.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)

2009.02.02, SJ

User support is not mandatory any longer just because you
have specified the --with-tokendb option.
(configure*, session.c)

Removed the sql.c file.
(sql.c)

Log the time of virus checking.
(avir.c)

2009.02.01, SJ

Modified the webui authentication. Now it uses its own
method instead of relying on the webserver. Currently
only the regular htpasswd format password file is supported.
Plans to add ldap and mysql authentication support, too.
(webui/*)

2009.01.29, SJ

Fixed a bug in the clearhash() function.
(hash.c)

Enhanced the training stuff.

Added a Hungarian language virus notification template.
(templates/template.virus-hu)



0.4.0-rc2:

2009.01.08, SJ

Even more serious code refactoring. I modified the SQL statement to
query all the needed tokens at once. It should result a faster SQL
lookup.
(lots of *.h and *.c)

2009.01.04, SJ

Code refactoring: simplified structures.
(lots of *.h and *.c)


2009.01.02, SJ

Removed the holddir configuration parameter.
(session.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)

2008.12.29, SJ

Fill automatically the uid field when adding a new user.

Fixed a bug in the example ldif file.
(ldap/example.ldif)

2008.12.14, SJ

Web ui fixes.
(webui/mysql.php, webui/ldap.php, webui/users.php)

2008.12.13, SJ

Removed the cgi utilities since the web ui is a nicer implementation.
(*cgi.c, Makefile.in, configure*)

Added training support to the web ui.
(webui/config.in.php, webui/q.php)

The mail administrators may edit the per user whitelists as well
as the global whitelist.
(webui/mysql.php, webui/ldap.php)

Removed some unused configuration parameters from example.conf
(example.conf, cfg.c, cfg.h)


2008.12.12, SJ

Mydb modifications: added a qcache daemon to enable the clapf
daemon to query tokens from the daemon.
Please note that this is an experimental feature, and
subject to changes in the future.
(session.c, xdb.c, mydb.h)

2008.12.10, SJ

Added the anti-virus engine info to the notification.
(templates.c, templates.g, session.c, templates/template.virus)

2008.12.07, SJ

Working user-, alias- and policy handling with both
LDAP and MySQL backend.
(webui/*)

2008.12.04, SJ

Template based virus notifications.
(templates/, templates.c, templates.h)

2008.11.27, SJ

Modified the t_policy table to use tinyint types for storing
boolean (0 or 1) values to use less space.
(policy.sql)

LDAP version of the policy storage is available. Add the
ldap/clapf-policy.schema file to your openldap schemas.
For an example ldif file, see the ldap/policy.ldif.

Please note that I have added an attribute called
policyGroupId to qmail.schema to store the policy_group
parameter for the given user.

(policy.c, policy.h, session.c, ldap/clapf-policy.schema)

Remove the message from quarantine if the user releases
the message.
(webui/q.php)

2008.11.26, SJ

An early bird policy is available. Please extend the user
table as follows: ALTER TABLE user ADD COLUMN policy_group int(4) DEFAULT 0;

The default policy group (0) is just the same, as the configuration
you have in clapf.conf. Please see the policy.sql for list, what you
can override on a per user or per group basis.

Currently the policy stuff can be in mysql (the same place where your
userdb is). An LDAP version is to come soon. Then the web ui will be
updated, let the administrators set different policies.
(policy.c, policy.h, policy.sql, session.c, configure*)

Added a new clapf.conf variable called "deliver_infected_email".
If enabled (1) - disabled (0) by default - then clapf will deliver
the malware to the user. Enable it with caution if you really need
it! Of course, it can be enabled on a per user basis, so you can
have all the malware and still your users can be safe.
(cfg.c, cfg.h)

(credits: Miklos Toldi)

2008.11.25, SJ

Initial steps for policy support.
(policy.c, policy.h, session.c)

2008.11.24, SJ

situation resulting possible false positives.
(parser.c)

You don't have to set debug=1 in a separate config

*****************

0.3.31:

2008.11.11, SJ

Lots of minor fixes and clarifications.
(credits: tompos)

2008.11.04, SJ

Added the web UI, a set of PHP scripts replacing the
CGI utilities.
(webui/)

2008.10.25, SJ

Redesigned the username/uid vs. email address query.
You must specify the --with-userdb option. The ldap
support is not fully functional yet. The clapf.schema
must be fixed.
(users.c, users.h, clapf.h, sql.c, sql.h, configure*, ...)

2008.10.23, SJ

Thinking about the problem I realised that I still need the
t_white_list table. It holds all the user's whitelisted addresses
in one blob per user.
(db-*.sql)

2008.10.20, SJ

Modified whitelist support. I changed the 'user' table to hold
a new column (whitelist) with type blob. Now the whitelist column
stores all the whitelisted email addresses for the given uid one
email address in a line, ie. separated by a new line character.

Now both the clapf daemon and the spamdrop utility is able to detect
backscatter spam emails. This feature is still experimental.
(spamdrop.c, parser.h. parser.c, bayes.h, bayes.c)

2008.05.05, SJ

Added the mydomains parameter. The clapf daemon will not insert the
anti backscatter header (our_signo in clapf.conf) if the recipient
is in mydomains.

So to use the anti-backscatter help feature, set the following in clapf.conf:

mydomains=@yourdomain1,@yourdomain2,...
our_signo=X-Anti-Backscatter: abcde123

You may use the $(libexecdir)/clapf/spamsum utility to create the spam sums, eg.
$(libexecdir)/clapf/spamsum messagefile1 messagefile2 ... messagefileN

To use the signatures, set the sig_db parameter in clapf.conf

Please note that the spamsum project is the work of Andrew Tridgell.
(spamdrop.c, contrib/spamsum/*)

The util/check_clapf.sh script honors the CLAPF_USER parameter in Makefile.
(Makefile.in, util/check_clapf.sh.in)

2008.02.04, SJ

Removed the rude_surbl directive. One hit is enough to trigger
the spammy result.
(cfg.h, cfg.c, score.c, example.conf)

If you want to present all the IP-addresses from the "Received: from"
lines to blacklists, then use the --enable-all-received configure
option. The default is to check only the host passing the email to us.
(parser.c, configure.in, configure)

2008.01.28, SJ

Added white list support. If the sender is on the list, then
no spam check performed (except blackhole) and return spamicity=0.5.

If you want to use this feature use --enable-whitelist and please
update your SQL tables with the following sql statements:

create table if not exists t_white_list (
        email char(64) primary key not null,
        uid int default 0
);

create index t_white_list_idx on t_white_list (email);

(session.c, spamdrop.c, sql.c, sql.h, configure*)

2008.01.27, SJ

A strange problem may occur at a specific condition: clapf may send
two period(.) commands while passing the message back to postfix, so
postfix replies with a 250...500 message. Anyway the message gets
delivered. I fixed the problem.
(smtp.c, spamdrop.c)

2008.01.23, SJ

This is an extensive modification. I redesigned the spam handling blocks
and made several changes. If you are using the mysql token databases
update your table structure by issuing the following sql commands:

alter table t_token add column timestamp int default 0;
update t_token set timestamp=UNIX_TIMESTAMP();


Redesigned the training process as follows: removed the train utility,
and you can train with the spamdrop command, eg.

to train with a spam message:
spamdrop -c /usr/local/etc/clapf.conf -S < rfc822_format_message

or to train with a ham message:
spamdrop -c /usr/local/etc/clapf.conf -H < rfc822_format_message

Clapf automatically learns an email if:
- initial_1000_learning=1 is set in clapf conf and we have less then
1000 ham or spam
- training_mode=1 is set in clapf.conf and the message is surely spam,
but its spaminess is under 0.99
- training_mode=1 is set in clapf.conf and the message is surely ham,
but its spaminess is above 0.1
- the message came to the blackhole(aka. minefield address), but its
spaminess is under 0.99
 
Now all the token backends stores (and updates) the timestamp of
the given token. This gives you the ability to remove any token
which is no longer used to free storage space.
You may use the util/purge-mysql.sql SQL script if using MySQL,
or the util/purge-sqlite3.sh with SQLite3.

These scripts remove any token if it's:
- not used in the last 90 days
- not used in the last 60 days and 2*nham + nspam < 5
- not used in the last 15 days and nham+nspam = 1

This helps to keep the database size in the required minimum size
while preserving accuracy.

2008.01.20, SJ

Modified the SQLite3 stuff, to handle timestamps, suitable for removing
obsoleted tokens later. And it SQLite3 database allows only uid=0 tokens.
So if you need multiple user ids, you need a single SQLite3 database per
users or switch to MySQL. Please recreate your token database from scratch
to use the new features.
(configure.in, configure, db-sqlite3.sql, example.conf, prepare-sql.c, sql.c, sql.h, sqlite3.c, train.c, bayes.c)

Modified the APHash() function to cut in half the available numeric
address space if using SQLite3. Clapf stores the token values as
an integer instead a text. This also means that you have to recreate
your token database.
(config.h, db-sqlite3.sql, misc.c, bayes.c, prepare-sql.c, sqlite3.c, qs.c)

2008.01.13, SJ

Spamdrop does not want to bother with the queue directory if
we don't want to store the message for later retraining.

To enable any rbl or url bl, use --enable-rbl instead --enable-surbl.
(configure, configure.in)

2008.01.08, SJ

The spaminess_of_text_and_base64 feature is disabled by default. Enable it
if you want to mark base64 encoded _textual_ messages as spam, by setting
spaminess_of_text_and_base64=0.9996 in clapf.conf
(cfg.c, example.conf)

Well, the inverse chi square algorithm should use not the most interesting
top15 tokens, but all the tokens above a certain significance. This can be
adjusted by the exclusion_radius. If you set it to 0.375, then we will include
all the tokens with spamicity 0...0.125 or 0.875...1.000.
So please update your exclusion_radius parameter, and set it to somewhere 0.375.

(rbl.h, rbl.c, bayes.c)

2007.09.10, SJ

Modified the training method: instead forwarding to spam+user@domain,
forward it to user+spam@domain. And similarly: instead forwarding to
ham+user@domain, forward it to user+ham@domain.
This gives you the possibility to user per user SQLite3 token databases.

2007.09.07, SJ

Add a spammy token in case of a RTF attachment.
(bayes.c)

2007.09.06, SJ

Set spamicity to 0.5 for tokens seen not more than twice.
(sql.c)

2007.09.05, SJ

Minor fixes.

2007.09.03, SJ

spamstat.pl can handle spamdrop lines as well.
(stat/spamstat.pl)

2007.09.02, SJ

UTF-8 fix.
(parser.c, parser.h)

2007.08.28, SJ

The max_ham_spamicity variable obsoletes the former max_junk_spamicity
and max_embed_image_spamicity variables. Its purpose is to define a
spam probability limit to ham messages. If a certain message has a
greater probability than this value, some rude anti-spam mesaures
take place. It defaults to max_ham_spamicity=0.41
(cfg.h, cfg.c, spamdrop.c, spam-fwd-train.c, bayes.c)

Improved parsing.
(bayes.c, parser.h, parser.c)

2007.08.26, SJ

Even better configure and Makefile

2007.08.24, SJ

Added pid file support: clapf writes its pid to a file.
(clapf.c, cfg.h, cfg.c)

2007.08.22, SJ

Better configure script and Makefile

2007.08.20. SJ

Added a statistic logging to spamdrop ("<uid> got HAM|SPAM")
(misc.c, session.c, spamdrop.c)

2007.08.10, SJ

Removed the --enable-mysql configure option and the HAVE_MYSQL_TOKEN_DATABASE
definition. Now I use only the #ifdef HAVE_MYSQL option.
(configure.in, configure, session.c, bayes.c, spamdrop.c, train.c, traincgi.c, spam-fwd-train.c)

Added LMTP support. From now clapf will receive messages via LMTP from postfix.
Replace the following in /etc/postfix/main.cf:

content_filter = smtp:[127.0.0.1]:10025

with

content_filter = lmtp:[127.0.0.1]:10025

Please note that I have not implemented the ENHANCEDSTATUSCODE and the
PIPELINING extensions. It seems that postfix is fine without them.
(session.c)

Parsing the message outside the bayes_file() function.
(bayes.c, session.c, spamdrop.c, test.c)

Removed the --disable-antispam option. The configure script will exit
if you do not specify neither an antivirus package nor a tokendb type.
(configure.in, configure)


2007.08.08, SJ

Fixed a bug in the 'train' utility to update the t_misc table
while using an SQLite database.
(train.c)

Ongoing SQLite3 integration
(sql.c, session.c, spamdrop.c, train.c)

2007.08.07, SJ

Fixing uid handling in bayes.c
(bayes.c)

2007.08.04, SJ

Continued to improve spamdrop integration. You may use a single
/etc/maildroprc file to let all users use spamdrop and set up
the two training email addresses (see maildroprc):
(spamdrop.c, sql.c, sql.h, bayes.c, mysql.c)

2007.08.02, SJ

Store metadata even if uid=0.
(mysql.c)

2007.07.22, SJ

Fixed an issue around the Qcache updating while training.
(mysql.c)

2007.07.20, SJ

SQL table names are defined in config.h.
(config.h, example.conf)

Added sqlite3 support for Qcache and spam evaluation.

2007.07.17, SJ

Added the silently_discard_infected_email option that allows you
to decide whether to silently discard the infected message (1)
or let a bounce get back to the sender (0). (credits: Toms Trankalis)
(cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf, session.c)

Removed the attachment dumping and analysing code
(parser.c, bayes.c, example.conf)

2007.07.15, SJ

Removed the "too much spam in top15" feature.
(hash.c)

Slightly modified spaminess calculation
(hash.c, hash.h, bayes.c)

*********************************************

0.3.29:

2007.07.16, SJ

Fixed a compilation issue on FreeBSD (credits: Toms Trankalis)
(cgi.c)

Fixed a configure issue.
(configure.*, Makefile.in)

2007.07.11, SJ

Added iterative training to the email forwarder trainer. It trains the
email until it classifies it correctly (but max. 5 times, see the
MAX_ITERATIVE_TRAIN_LOOPS parameter in config.h)
(misc.c, misc.h, spam-fwd-train.c, config.h)

Minor fix in the Qcache daemon.
(qs.c)

2007.07.10, SJ

The parser discards any header line except a few such as Received, From,
To, Subject, Content-type, Content-Transfer-Encoding
(parser.c)

2007.07.09, SJ

Added a query cache. If you want to retrieve lots of tokens from a MySQL
table, it might take x * 100 ms. Though it's usually acceptable for a
small network, a query cache might improve the performance. MySQL has an
internal query cache. Unfortunately MySQL discards it if the t_token table
is written (update/delete/insert/...) which occurs frequently if you choose
the Training Until Mature (TUM) trainig mode.

So I decided to write my own version of query cache. The "qs" utility is able
to listen on both TCP and Unix domain socket. It handles all the select and
update requests aimed at the t_token table. It's important that it supports
only the new hashed format tokens.

If you want to use it, adjust the following parameters:

qcache_addr=127.0.0.1
qcache_port=48791

or

qcache_socket=/tmp/qcache

Qcache syslog()'s the achieved cache hit rate so you can track if it's really
useful for you.

Please note that this feature is still experimental. All comments are welcome.

(qcache.c, qcache.h, qs.c, bayes.c, mysql.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)

Added an option for chroot() environments and clamd. If you run clapf in a
chroot()'ed environment you might find it painful to run clamd in the chroot
environment too (because clapf passes the filename as it sees, eg. /opt/av/tmp/xxxxxxxxx).

Now you are good to to run clamd outside the chroot, just set the chrootdir
parameter in clapf.conf pointing to the chroot path.

if your chroot / is /myjail then set:

chrootdir=/myjail

(clamd.c, clamd.h, session.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)

2007.07.06, SJ

Eliminated multiple mysql_real_connect() calls in the same session.
(session.c, bayes.c, mysql.c)

Modified the spamdrop utility to use only the getuid() function
to get the user id of the recipient.
(spamdrop.c)

Fixed a bug in splitmbox.
(splitmbox.c)

2007.07.03, SJ

Removed hash_db support
(cfg.h, cfg.c, clapf.c, bayes.c, example.conf)

2007.07.02, SJ

Added an option to instantiate a spamy token for octet-stream attachments.
It may help you to fight PDF spam.
(example.conf, cfg.h. cfg.c, parser.h, parser.c, bayes.c)

2007.06.28, SJ

Adding \r\n at the end of every line. Qmail really needs this.
http://pobox.com/~djb/docs/smtplf.html
(splitmbox.c)

2007.06.26, SJ

Fixed spamdrop to be able to read message through pipe, thus
can be used in .mailfilter in local delivery mode.
(spamdrop.c)

Messages are saved to mysql table instead the queue directory.
Do not forget to periodically purge aged messages from the t_queue
table, eg.
echo "delete t_queue where UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - ts > 604800" | mysql


(db-new.sql, db-old.sql, mysql.c, spamdrop.c, spam-fwd-train.c, crtab)

2007.06.21, SJ

Added a white list option: if the sender of the email (From: ...)
has sent us at least 10 good emails and 0 spam let his email
come without statistical analysis.
(bayes.c)

2007.06.16, SJ

Fixed a typo in bayes.c
(bayes.c)

Fixed potential underflow when while corrective TUM training.
(mysql.c)

2007.06.15, SJ

Fixed a bug around assembling the extra header for insertion.
(session.c)

2007.06.14, SJ

Added TUM support for the training stuff.
(mysql.c, train.c, traincgi.c, misc.h, bayes.c, session.c)

2007.06.13, SJ

Added merged group support. Now both shared and merged groups are available.
Added TUM (Train Until Mature) training mode. Now both TOE (Train On Error)
and TUM mode is supported.
(mysql.c, bayes.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)

2007.06.09, SJ

Updated the parser not to chain between individual header lines.
(parser.c, parser.h)

2007.06.07, SJ

Updated the parser routine to generate token pairs too. Thus
simplified the training utilities.
(parser.c, parser.h, train.c, traincgi.c, spam-fwd-train.c)

Removed the unnecessary ptable.h file.

Added html decoder function.
(decoder.c, decoder.h, parser.c)

2007.06.01, SJ

Fixed a bug around the spamicity calculation
(bayes.c)

The configure script now honors the --sysconfdir option,
and you don't have to specify the -c /path/to/clapf.conf
if its default path is fine for you.
(configure*, clapf-config.h.in, bayes.c)
(credits: Johannes Russek)

Added a command line switch (-d) allowing clapf going to
the background.
(clapf.c, config.h)
(credits: Johannes Russek)

2007.05.30, SJ

Fixed some compile time issues in case of a setup without
the antispam stuff.
(credits: Johannes Russek)

Introduced the APHash() function. It creates a 2^64 bits version of
the token strings in the mysql table resulting a much smaller table.
See http://www.partow.net/programming/hashfunctions/#APHashFunction
for more details on this hashing function.
(misc.c, mysql.c, cdb.c, db.sql, util/kcdb_mysql.sh)

2007.05.29, SJ

Tokens are mysql escaped.
(mysql.c)

2007.05.27, SJ

Fixed a bug in the spam-fwd-utility, and added some logging too.
(spam-fwd-train.c)

2007.05.24, SJ

Fixed the same bug in parsembox as in splitmbox
(parsembox.c)

2007.05.23, SJ

"make install" copies the splitmbox utility to $(root)$(DESTDIR)$(bindir)

Fixed a bug in splitmbox.
(splitmbox.c)

2007.05.22, SJ

Fixed the kcdb_mysql.sh script. It did not imported the tokens into
the mysql database without the presence of the cdb utility.
(util/kcdb_mysql.sh)

Better quoted-printable decoding
(parser.c)

2007.05.21, SJ

Fixed logging to mysql table using traincgi.
(traincgi.c)

The "make install" command does not overwrite the existing clapf.conf.
You should review what's new and update your existing configuration file.
(Makefile.in)

Fixed a bug in the training utilities
(mysql.c, train.c, traincgi.c, spam-fwd-train.c)

Cut the number of database lookups half - if possible. It's no use to query
the single tokens from the database if we can classify the message according
to the token phrases. This is (ok, should be) the case after proper training
most of the time.
(bayes.c)

2007.05.19, SJ

Updating documentation
(doc/html/*)

2007.05.18, SJ

Added personal statistics
(statcgi.c, trainlogcgi.c, messages.h*)

2007.05.17, SJ

Added a new training method by forwarding the message to spam+user@domain
or to ham+user@domain.
(spam-fwd-train.c, mysql.c, Makefile.in)

2007.05.15, SJ

Added mysql support as a backend for tokens. It can be used instead
of the cdb backend. Use the --with-tokendb=... configuration option.
(bayes.c, cdb.c, mysql.c)

Do not chain with URLs
(bayes.c)

2007.05.14, SJ

Modified the kcdb.sh and kcdb_mysql.sh scripts to handle Maildir format mboxes too.
Removed the maildir.sh script.
(util/kcdb.sh, util/kcdb_mysql.sh)

Removed the perl/mbox.pl script. Not used.

2007.05.04, SJ

Degenerate tokens if they end with punctuation
(misc.c, misc.h, parser.c)

0.3.29-rc2:

2007.05.02, SJ

Created a shell script to add users to the spam quarantine.
(util/user2sq.sh) 

2007.04.27, SJ

Use the single token hash (shash) if we have very few phrases
(bayes.c)

2007.04.24, SJ

Removed trailing space from skipped header definitions.
(shdr.h)

2007.04.19, SJ

Fixed a 'Content-Type' issue.
(parser.c)

TRAINING/tokens.sql and user.sql merged into db.sql
(db.sql)

2007.04.18, SJ

Removed the unnecessary <openssl/evp.h> header file inclusion
(decoder.c)

Fixed compile time warnings about signed-unsigned differences
(misc.h, misc.c, parser.c)

2007.04.05, SJ

Added an extra log entry to collect per user/email address ham/spam statistics.
(misc.c, misc.h, session.c)

2007.04.03, SJ

Do not count invalid junk characters in the "To:" lines. I got
some emails containing Czech and Romanian names with unusual
letters - found in the invalid_junk_characters[] array - causing
false positives problems.
(parser.c)

2007.03.20, SJ

Minor fix in the graph shell script.
(stat/clapf-rrd-graph.sh)

2007.03.19, SJ

A little bit nicer spam quarantine. A cosmetic only change.
(spamcgi.c, trainlogcgi.c, usercgi.c, doc.html/style.css)


0.3.29-rc1:

2007.03.07, SJ

The spamcgi utility limits the length of the subject to MAX_CGI_SUBJECT_LEN (see config.h)
(spamcgi.c, config.h)

2007.03.06, SJ

The splitmbox utility terminates line with CR-LF (\r\n).
(splitmbox.c)

Check for CR-LF at the end of the mail header in the black.pl script
and fixed the RFC-822 date string.
(blackhole/black.pl)

2007.03.03, SJ

Added the "X-Keywords" header field to the exclusion list.
(shdr.h)

The skip_headers[] list is case insensitive now.
(parser.c)

2007.02.27, SJ

The exclude_unknown_tokens configuration parameter has been removed and
introduced the exclusion_radius parameter that can be used to eliminate
neutral tokens.
(cfg.h, cfg.c, example.conf, bayes.c)

Modified the parser routine to include DSN report attachments.
(parser.c)

More header stuff has been discarded. You may customise the excluded header
lines in shdr.h.
(shdr.h)

2007.02.26, SJ

Modified the chi2inv() function according to http://garyrob.blogs.com/chi2p.py
(chi.h. chi.c, hash.c)

2007.02.17, SJ

Gcc optimisation level changed from -O3 to -O2.
(configure.in)

2007.02.07, SJ

Added an option allowing you to reject spam. If you want this to
happen set the spaminess_oblivion_limit variable to a value above
your spam_overall_limit (eg. 0.99) and clapf will drop all the
spam if its spamicity value is >= 0.99. I think it may be useful
on some outgoing smtp servers eliminating most of the outgoing
spam from your own network. Be careful with this setting.
(cfg.h, cfg.c, session.c, example.conf)

2007.02.05, SJ

Modified the syslog messages slightly to become more unified.
(avast.c, avg.c, clamd.c, drweb.c, kav.c, session.c, bayes.c)

2007.02.02, SJ

Added a configuration directive (keep_queue_files) to determine whether to
keep the queue files after processing. It's useful only for debugging. If
you want to keep those files set keep_queue_files=1 otherwise they are
removed (this is the default behaviour).

(cfg.c, cfg.h, session.c, example.conf)

2007.01.16, SJ

Added a date field to the spam quarantine.
(spamcgi.c)

2007.01.10, SJ

Added a new feature to fight embedded image spam. If the message is not good
enough (=its spamicity value is greater than max_embed_image_spamicity) the
message is marked as spam. This way messages from strangers with images may
land in your spam folder.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, bayes.c, examples.conf)


0.3.28:

2007.01.08, SJ

Modified the shell scripts (util/*) and set the PATH variable.

Removed the clamav database upgrade stuff from the util/ directory.
(util/)

2007.01.07, SJ

The CDB Perl modul is not needed any longer since the cdb utility (part of
the tinycdb package) is able to create cdb files, eg. "cdb -c -m -w tokens.cdb tokens.raw"
(see the cdb (1) man page)

2007.01.04, SJ

Extended the max. length of the tokens (18->19) thus the Content-Disposition
header line also fits.
(config.h, perl/shrink.pl)

2007.01.03, SJ

Added a new variable (penalize_embed_images) to fight image spam aggressively.
If set (penalize_embed_images=1) it creates a special spammy token (EMBED*) thus
increasing the spam probability. Please note that this variable has no affects
on attached or linked (<img src="http://....">) images.

If you really hate all the embedded images you may add the following line to
/etc/postfix/body_checks:

/src\s*\=(3D){0,}\s*["']?cid:/

2007.01.01, SJ

Count invalid junk characters only if it's not an UTF-8 encoded part.
The FSM newsletters tend to contain such a strange character sequence (=E2=80=94).
I don't get it why the word Magazines should be written as "Magazine=E2=80=99s"...

2006.12.22, SJ

Fixed a bug preventing 'make install' to copy the default configuration file.
(Makefile.in)

Added an option (useful for package builders) to install clapf under a different root
directory, eg. 'make install root=/tmp/aaa' installs clapf under /tmp/aaa/usr/local/...
(Makefile.in, configure.in)

2006.12.15, SJ

Fixed the fix_url() function to handle complex URLs properly:
http://www.ajandekkaracsonyra.hu/email.php?page=email&cmd=unsubscribe&email=yy@xxxx.kom
(misc.c)

2006.12.11, SJ

Modified the translate() and fix_url() functions to leave the URLs intact
and to allow us to capture url redirects such as
http://www.google.com/url?q=http://1234567.026.annasiksboredok.com/
(parser.c, misc.c)


2006.12.06, SJ

Skip the "User-Agent:" header field and the 3 letter long names of the months.
(shdr.h)

Clean up the extracted attachments while parsing a message.
(parser.c)

**********************************

0.3.28-rc3:

2006.11.27, SJ

Added Word support via the catdoc package (http://www.45.free.net/~vitus/software/catdoc/).
Tested with 0.94.2.

(bayes.c, cfg.h, cfg.c, example.conf)

2006.11.18, SJ

The "X-MimeOLE:" header line is skipped. Remove it from shdr.h if you want to look for it.
(shdr.h)

2006.11.16, SJ

Added OCR support via the gocr and netpbm packages. You need gocr (http://jocr.sourceforge.net/)
0.41 is known to work, and netpbm (http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/), 10.18.12 should be fine.

2006.11.13, SJ

Modified inject_mail() function to insert a spam prefix to the Subject: line
if it is a spam.
(smtp.c, config.h, cfg.c)

Skip the names of the months. Using any date would bias the affected tokens.
(parser.c, shdr.h)

2006.11.09, SJ

Modified the parser routine to recognise the oriental spam better. The SURBL checks
are performed only if we are still unsure and no enough strange/junk characters to
eliminate the unnecessary DNS lookups.
(parser.c, misc.c, misc.h, bayes.c)

2006.10.28, SJ

Modified the parser routine to include the Content-Type and Content-Transfer-Encoding
element to fight image spam better. Added a new variable (penalize_images). Set it to
1 to enable or 0 (or commented out) to disable.
(parser.c, bayes.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)

2006.10.27, SJ

Removed the "#include <ldap.h>" reference from the 12th line of user.c.
It's unnecessary if you want to hold user preferences in a MySQL table.
(user.c)

2006.10.25, SJ

Modified the TRAINING/tokens.sql and util/kcdb_mysql.sh scripts for the easier
Maildir format training.
(TRAINING/tokens.sql, util/kcdb_mysql.sh)


**********************************

0.3.28-rc2:

2006.10.13, SJ

Log token database training action into mysql table. Look at the
mysqltraininglogtable parameter in example.conf.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, cgi.c, cgi.h, traincgi.c, trainlogcgi.c, user.sql, example.conf)

The "Next" and "Last" messages can be seen only if you have more than 'page_len'
messages in your spam quarantine.
(spamcgi.c)

2006.10.10, SJ

Spamdrop works from CDB database even if we have compiled with --enable-hash-db
(bayes.c)

2006.10.09, SJ

Changed the default queue directory to /opt/av/tmp
(example.conf)

Added a check to prevent creating an IP-address entry in the blackhole directory
if there's no valid Received: line.
(blackhole/black.pl)

Added a Hungarian messages.h file. If you want to localise your own language
create a messages.h.xx (where 'xx' is your language) file, then translate and
send it to me - please.
(messages.h.hu)

2006.10.06, SJ

The traincgi utility is able to save the trained messages.
(traincgi.c, cgi.c, cgi.h, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)

2006.10.05, SJ

Added an extra header to specify the reason why clapf decided about a certain
message that it's a spam. Expect more definitions in the future.
(session.c, messages.h)

Fixed the configure script to let the --disable- option to work.
(credits: Anatoly Shipitsin)
(configure.*, Makefile.in)

2006.10.04, SJ

Added a syslog support to the black.pl script.
(blackhole/black.pl)

2006.10.03, SJ

Fixed a bug in the parse() routine. Clapf now checks the second Received line,
ie. the machine contacted you. Of course you may adjust clapf to check the first
machine (ie. in the last Received: line), but please note that the Received
lines can be spoofed, that's why I decided to check the last computer in the
Received: chain (not counting ourself). If you want to hack this feature, look
at parser.c around the 125th line and adjust (or remove it for the last Received
line) the "state.ipcnt < 2" snippet.
(parser.c)

2006.10.02, SJ

Modified the blackhole feature to use a special directory holding
IP-address entries instead a mysql table.
(black.c, black.h, bayes.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf, blackhole/black.pl, blackhole/black.crtab.sh)

2006.09.29, SJ

Changed the default action to "junk" in passmail.
(passmail.c)

2006.09.28, SJ

Added a paging option to the spam quarantine.
(spamcgi.c, cfg.h, cfg.c)

2006.09.20, SJ

Commented out a disturbing print line in the maillog processing Perl script
(stat/process_syslog.pl)


************************

0.3.28-rc1:

2006.09.06, SJ

The passmail utility uses read() system calls instead of fgets().
(passmail.c)

2006.09.04, SJ

Added a paging option to the spam quarantine listing. Please
recompile the spamcgi and traincgi utilities as they cannot see
the older spam messages because in order for the correct paging
now we use a "timestamp." (YYYYMMDDhhmmss.) before the original name
of the spam file. I recommend you either to remove or backup/deliver
them if you need them any longer.
(spamcgi.c)

Added common header links.
(spamcgi.c, usercgi.c, cfg.h, cfg.c, example.conf)

2006.09.01, SJ

Modified the spamcgi cgi utility to print html links instead
of form submit buttons. I found this a more elegant and nicer
solution.
(spamcgi.c)

The usercgi cgi utility adds a few html tags at the bottom of
the generated html page. It's a cosmetic only fix.
(usercgi.c)

Fixed a looping problem while trying to deliver a message from
the spam quarantine.
(smtp.c)

2006.08.25, SJ

Modified the hash table creation in the hash_db memory table
for a smaller memory footprint.
(hash_db.h, hash_db.c)

2006.08.21, SJ

Binary messages (particularly those containing NUL characters) are
handled properly.
(config.h, smtp.c)

************************

0.3.27:

2006.08.18, SJ

Added a fix in 'make install' to copy the default config file in case
of a fresh install with no previous config file.
(Makefile.in)

2006.08.15, SJ

Modified the mail injection to allow multiple headers to be inserted
in case of spam. I try it with fgets() again with a dirty hack to
handle binary emails.
(config.h, cfg.h, cfg.c, session.c, smtp.c)

(credits: Mariano Reingart)

0.3.27-rc3:

2006.07.17, SJ

Modified the inject_mail() function to able to handle binary messages correctly.
(smtp.c)

Fixed typo in mysql.c. The word 'token' was misspelled as 'tokem' causing error
in database training.
(mysql.c)

2006.07.11, SJ

Modified the configure script to build the cgi utilities if we
have an LDAP user database.
(configure*, Makefile.in)

2006.07.06, SJ

Tested the configuration with Active Directory and added a little docs
on this issue. The name of the LDAP entries can be changed they are defined
in user.h.
(user.c, user.h)

2006.06.30, SJ

Modified clapf to be able to send spam to an smtp server other than our
postfix on 127.0.0.1:10026. It's useful if you want to create a distributed
setup, eg. if you may want to implement a spam quarantine on a dedicated
machine other than the computer where your users have their own mailboxes.
In this case set spam_smtp_addr and spam_smtp_port to point to this box.

Otherwise set spam_smtp_addr and spam_smtp_port to the same values
like postfix_addr and postfix_port respectively (this is the default).
(session.c, cfg.c)


************************

0.3.27-rc2:

2006.06.29, SJ

Created the spamdrop utility to use it with an LDA such as maildrop.

You may use the following code snippet with maildrop to collect spam in the
junk folder:

`/usr/local/bin/spamdrop /usr/local/etc/clapf.conf `
if($RETURNCODE == 1)
{
       to "mail/junk"
}

(Makefile.in, spamdrop.c, doc/man/spamdrop.1)

Removed the hash database conditional stuff from spamtest. It's not useful
to read the tokens into memory while testing a single message.
(test.c)

Modified a decription slightly in clapf.schema
(ldap/clapf.schema)

2006.06.27, SJ

Added an option to let clapf connect to the MySQL server through a unix domain socket
(cfg.h, cfg.c, black.c, user.c, user.h, passmail.c, smtp.c, train.c, traincgi.c, example.conf)

2006.06.23, SJ

Modified the surbl code to check the URLs in the message against the surbl
domain(s) defined only if we are not sure that the email is certainly ham
or spam thus eliminating unecessary (and costly) SURBL lookups.
In other words the surbl code is only used if we are unsure whether the
message is spam or ham.
(bayes.c)

2006.06.19, SJ

Modified the configure script to have a better (and gentoo compatible) mysql check.
You should add the --enable-mysql if you need mysql support.
(configure*, Makefile.in)
(credits: Anatoly Shipitsin)


************************

0.3.27-rc1:


2006.06.12, SJ

Fixed small typo in doc/html/config.html in the esf_h section.
(doc/html/config.html)

2006.06.06, SJ

The findnode() function returns the pointer of the node if possible.
(hash.h, hash.c)

Added a small code to the surbl support to able to mark the message
as spam if it has too many SURBL caught URLs though the spamicity
does not reach the spam limit. See the following parameters:
rude_surbl and spaminess_of_caught_by_surbl
(cfg.h, cfg.c, bayes.c, example.conf)

2006.06.05, SJ

Added a spec file suitable to create an RPM package from clapf.
(clapf.spec)
(credits: Tim Philips)

2006.06.02, SJ

Changed the defaults of both esf_h and esf_s to 1. It needs
more investigation when using non integer degrees of freedom values.
(cfg.c, example.conf, doc/html/config.html)

Added support to use the GNU GSL library if available. It has a better
chi square function implementation as it allows the degrees of freedom
to be a double type. Our internal implementation allows only integer as
the degrees of freedom though current tests show that it may be just fine.
And the chi square function went to a separate file.
(chi.c, chi.h, configure*, hash.c, hash.h)

2006.06.01, SJ

Added three more characters to the invalid_junk_characters array
(ijc.h)

************************


0.3.26:

2006.05.23, SJ

Checking for content-type-encoding was case sensitive. Fixed.
(parser.c)

2006.05.18, SJ

Added the 'X-Mailer' stuff to the skip_headers[] list.
Remove it if it bothers you.
(shdr.h)

Fixed 'Subject' handling.
(parser.c)

2006.05.16, SJ

Fixed a minor bug in perl/shrink.pl to handle URLs properly
(perl/shrink.pl)

*******************************

0.3.26-rc3:

2006.05.10, SJ

Fixed the install entry in Makefile: do not try to install the passmail
utility if it is not compiled.
(credits: Pintr Tams)
(configure*, Makefile.in)

Fixed a minor bug in the configure script. When selecting clamd
the configure script has said "You have not selected any antivirus support.
clapf will not protect you from hostile code coming in e-mail", though
it did configured clamd antivirus support.

(credits: Pintr Tams)
(configure*)

2006.05.09, SJ

Modified the count_invalid_junk() function to replace junk characters
with JUNK_REPLACEMENT_CHAR
(misc.c)

2006.05.04, SJ

Virus quarantine directory is undefined from now. Let clapf
not collect infected files by default. Specify the quarantine_dir
variable in clapf.conf if you want to maintain a virus quarantine
directory.
(cfg.c, config.h)

Moved passmail in Makefile.in
(Makefile.in, configure*)

Antivirus documentation merged into av.html
(doc/html/av.html)

2006.05.03, SJ

Lower case is the default for now. If you want clapf to be case sensitive,
please use the --enable-case configure option. The --enable-lower option
is withdrawn. I recommend you to recreate the token database (CDB file).
(configure.*, misc.c, bayes.c)

If a token in the Subject: line is not found try it without the 'Subject*' prefix.
(bayes.c)

The SURBL* special token is only included in the token list if it the domain is
found in the SURBL database.
(bayes.c)

2006.04.27, SJ

Fixed the max_junk_spamicity declaration in cfg.h
(cfg.h)

2006.04.26, SJ

Passmail is able to move the spam into the quarantine or silently discard.
The action is stored either in mysql database or ldap directory.
(passmail.c, user.c, user.sql, ldap/clapf.schema)

Created the usercgi cgi utility to let users set their own preference.
(usercgi.c, user.c, user.h)

2006.04.25, SJ

Modified the traincgi utility a little.
(traincgi.c)

Tried to lowercase everything. Use the --enable-lower configure option.
I recommend you to recreate your token database (tokens.cdb)
(misc.c)

******************


0.3.26-rc2:

2006.04.19, SJ

Changed MAX_RCPT_TO 16->128. Adjust this variable to your need.
(config.h)

2006.04.11, SJ

Spam quarantine has been redesigned. Now each user has his own spam
quarantine and can manage it. You may store the users' email addresses
either in LDAP or Mysql database.
(passmail.c, session.c, spamcgi.c, smtp.c, smtp.h, cfg.c, cfg.h)

******************

0.3.26-rc1:

2006.04.07, SJ

Clapf now honors user preferences. For now the idea is very simple.
We have a CDB file containing emails and username mapping as well
as username and preferences mapping.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, perl/userpref.pl, session.c, user.c, misc.c)

2006.04.06, SJ

Modified the SURBL code to allow to query multiply URI blacklist domains.
If you want to do so build a comma separated list of URI blacklist domains.
(bayes.c)

Buffer overflow bug has fixed in the parser routine.
(parser.c)

2006.04.05, SJ

Added SURBL support. It is a kind of RBL list. It can be used to check domains in the message
against a central database. If the domain exists in the database a special token is created
SURBL*domainname and assigned 0.9999 as its spamicity.
(bayes.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, configure*, example.conf)

Fixed the fix_url() function :-)
(misc.c)

0.3.25:

2006.04.03, SJ

Cleaned under perl/ and util/ directories

**************************

0.3.25-rc4:

2006.03.31, SJ

Fixed minor typo in stat/clapf-rrd-graph-oneline.sh
(stat/clapf-rrd-graph-oneline.sh)

2006.03.29, SJ

Revised the HTML documentation.

2006.03.28, SJ

MIN_WORD_LEN raised 2->3 and MAX_WORD_LEN changed 24->18
If you get worse results feel free to change these values.
(config.h, perl/shrink.pl)

2006.03.22, SJ

Try to auto utf8- and quoted-printable decode lines. It should not hurt.
(parser.c)

Removed the question mark(?) from the translation table.
(trans.h)

2006.03.21, SJ

Modified the bayes_file() routine to let a junk email come in if its
spamicity score is under a certain limit (=max_junk_spamicity).
(bayes.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)

Removed the '' sign from the invalid_junk_characters list.
(ijc.h)

2006.03.20, SJ

Created ptable.h to hold a list words you don't want to train the database
with them. Also modified the perl/shrink.pl file according to this.
(train.c, traincgi.c, per/shrink.pl)

2006.03.17, SJ

Modified the configure.* scripts to build the splitmbox utility if the
antispam support is disabled.
(configure.in)

2006.03.16, SJ

Skip lines having an RFC822 formatted date (eg. "Tue, 14 Mar 2006 15:46:03 ")
to eliminate the impact of dates.
(parser.c)

Decremented the min_phrase_number from 40 to 30. (config.h, example.conf)

2006.03.14, SJ

Tried the following: create 2 hash tables: one holding only the single
tokens and the other only the phrases (token pairs). URLs are in both
tables. Now let's calculate the spamicity from both tables then choose
the one with greater deviation. Gave up using triplets any longer.
Testing in progress.
(perl/shrink.pl, bayes.c)

********************

0.3.25-rc3:

2006.03.13, SJ

Added a utility called splitmbox to split an mbox file to separate messages.
(splitmbox.c, Makefile.in, doc/man/splitmbox.1)

Ingore the "Date: " lines when parsing a message.
(perl/shrink.pl, shdr.h)

Changed the number of most interesting words from 20 to 15, because I use
token pairs only.
(config.h)

Got a mail having a boundary definition in the mail header but containing no
boundary line in the body. So I included a check for this.
(parser.c)

Store the URLs in the form of URL*domain.com, where domain.com is shortened
to fit in MAX+WORD_LEN size.
(misc.c, misc.h, bayes.c)

********************


0.3.25-rc2:

2006.03.09, SJ

Revised reloading clamav antivirus database. Some error happened
after the reload. Revised reload_clamav_db() function and removed
clam.c and clam.h. And added clamd support.
(clamd.c, clamd.h, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf, doc/html/config.html)

2006.03.07, SJ

Changed the time values from [usec] to [ms].
(bayes.c, avast.c, avg.c, drweb.c, kav.c, session.c)

Introduced a new storage device called hash_db. It reads the raw
token file into a hash (called t_hash). I expect a better speed.
Please note that it takes a few MBs extra memory per processes.
You may enable this feature by using a configure option called
--enable-hash-db
(configure.in, Makefile.in, hash_db.c, hash_db.h, cfg.h, cfg.c, example.conf)

Modified the mysql2cdb.pl script to create the raw token data file as well.
(perl/mysql2cdb.pl)

Changed the default concurrancy from postfix to clapf from 20 to 10.
(doc/html/install.html)

Introduced the kill_child() function to prevent a child to run for a long time.
You may use the session_timeout variable to set this value.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, session.c, example.conf, doc/html/config.hml)

2006.03.06, SJ

Tried a new method: use only the token pairs and single URIs. This
results a much smaller CDB database (cca. 1/3)
(perl/shrink.pl, util/kcdb_mysql.sh, util/mysql2cdb.sh, bayes.c)

Added a new variable (tv_sent) to track how much time clapf needs
to inject a single message back to clapf. Time values are printed
in msec instead of usec.
(session.c)

Fixed a bug around message injection if the spam_quarantine variable is set.
(session.c)

2006.03.02, SJ

Introduced two new hash to hold exclusively token pairs and triplets
respectively. If we have enough known triplets use only them in the
spamicity calculation. If we have not then try the same with the
pairs and even with the phrase hash. We may use the all token holding
hash as a last resort. This is because overlapping tokens contain
such a redundancy difficult to handle.
(bayes.c)

Simplified the boundary handling
(parser.c, parser.h)

Try to utf-8 decode everything in the buffer. It should not hurt.
(parser.c)

2006.03.01, SJ

Revised qouted-printable soft break handling
(parser.c)

Improved utf-8 decoding
(decoder.c)

Removed the paragraph sign from ijc.h
(ijc.h)

2006.02.28, SJ

Added Dr.Web antivirus support.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, drweb.c, drweb.h, example.conf, doc/html/config.html)

2006.02.27, SJ

Nesty bug was found. MUAs put a few lines at the beginning of the message.
When you test a single message with spamtest or you make the spamicity
database these lines are used. But clapf cannot see these lines when it
gets the message thus the calculated result might be different. I modified
the parser routine to discared these lines:
"Return-Path: ", "X-Original-To: "
and the first line if it starts with "From "
(parser.c, parser.h)

Fixed a bug in util/kcdb_mysql.sh
(util/kcdb_mysql.sh)

*********

2006.02.24, SJ

Intoduced a new hash containing only phrases (token pairs and triplets).
If we have more than min_phrase_number phrases, do not care about single
tokens.
(cfg.h, cfg.c, bayes.c, example.conf)

Raised MAX_SAMPLES_TO_CHOOSE from 15 to 20 because we have more tokens
by using phrases too.
(config.h)

Introduced the 'effective size factor' (ESF) variable to help against the
annoying redundancy. ys and yh are both set to 0.2 for now to test it.
If you want to disable the ESF set both esf_h and esf_s to 1.
(hash.c)

Released 0.3.24.

2006.02.23, SJ

Added the inverse chi-square algorithm
(hash.c)

Robinson probability is the default again
(util/kcdb.sh, util/kcdb_mysql.sh, util/mysql2cdb.sh)

2006.02.22, SJ

Removed left hard coded WORK_DIR from session.c
(session.c)
(credits: Anatoly Shipitsin)

Removed test (and annoying) stuff from the hash function
(hash.c)

2006.02.21, SJ

Thunderbird starts with a "From - Thu Sep 15 11:27:01 2005"-like line
(parsembox.c)

If clapf cannot read the specified file it returns ERR_BAYES_* and
clapf will syslog the event with its 'error code'.
(bayes.c, config.h)

Added Kaspersky (kav) support
(session.c, kav.c, kav.h, cfg.c, cfg.h, config.h, example.conf, doc/html/kav.html)

2006.02.20, SJ

Introduced the clamav html documentation file
(doc/html/clamav.html)

Replaced the configuration file options with a reference link in the
manual page.
(doc/man/clapf.8)

Replaced the relocate_timeout with relocate_delay
(cfg.h, cfg.c, traincgi.c, example.conf)

Created a configuration file directive list
(doc/html/config.html)

Modified the parser routine to skip specific message headers listed
in the shdr.h. Unfortunately my mail already contains some headers
I don't trust. This of course distorted the result clapf calculated.
(parser.c, shdr.h)

2006.02.17, SJ

Modified the parser routine to include all the header information
and to skip all the numeric only tokens. This increased the size
of my spamicity database with 3%.
(parser.c, bayes.c)

Minor fix in the util/kcdb_mysql.sh script
(util/kcdb_mysql.sh)

2006.02.16, SJ

Removed the use_quarantine configuration file option.
It is enough to check the quarantine_dir variable
(cfg.c, cfg.h, session.c, example.conf)

2006.02.15, SJ

Fixed bug in the translate function.
(misc.c)

Added a new configuration file option (exclude_unknown_tokens) to
exclude unknown tokens from the final calculation. If you have only
a few known token in the database and a lot of unknown token you
may experience higher false positives as well as false negatives
rate but you may catch such a spam which includes a single url or
image with some unknown tokens.
I recommend you to turn off this feature if it causes more trouble
than good.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, hash.c, bayes.c, example.conf)

2006.02.11, SJ

Reimplemented connection handling according to D.J. Berstein's
tcpserver. Postfix to clapf SMTP communication code went to session.*
(clapf.c, session.c, session.h, sig.c, sig.h)

2006.02.10, SJ

Moved cgi.c functionality to traincgi.c which compiles into traincgi
(cfg.c, traincgi.c, spamcgi.c, cfg.c cfg.h, example.conf, doc/man/clapf.8)

Simplified the 'train' utility
(train.c)

Redesigned configure script. It prints a summary of selected features.
--enable-clamav is renamed to --enable-libclamav
(configure*)

A very strange and nesty thing has happened. Suddenly all the children
one after one became zombies. I decided to disable the connection limiting
code until this issue would be resolved and let postfix to decide how many
connections to open for us.
(clapf.c)

2006.02.09, SJ

Modified debugging not show the spamicity of all the tokens just
the most interesting ones and print lines of the message being parsed
(hash.c, parser.c)

Added an option to determine what tokens to include in spamicity
calculation. The more use you use the more accurate result you get
at the cost of more queries against the database. By default all
tokens are used.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, bayes.c, example.conf)

No antivirus product selected by default, you should choose one (or more)
with the appropriate configure option.
(configure*)

Removed the spam training recommendation feature. I'm not sure that
it's useful.
(cfg.c, cfg.h, clapf.c)

MIME decoder was changed to understand one level nested attachments
(mime.c)

The spam quarantine cgi utility was changed to use spam_quarantine_dir
configuration file variable and it is able to deliver the message to
the recipient if the system administrator wants to do so.
(spamcgi.c)


2006.02.08, SJ

Cleaned up some code around antivirus handling
(clapf.c)

Cosmetic modification with AVG
(avg.c)

Modified the parser routine to handle base64 or quoted-printable encoded
Subject lines. Note I don't care about multiple encoded stuff eg.
Subject: =?iso-8859-2?Q?T?= =?iso-8859-2?Q?E?= =?iso-8859-2?Q?S?= =?iso-8859-2?Q?T?=

If a token is not found, convert it to upper than lower case and try again
(bayes.c)

Released 0.3.23-rc2.

2006.01.25, SJ

Removed the spam_quarantine variable, the spam_quarantine_dir variable
is sufficient alone.
(example.conf, clapf.c, doc/man/clapf.8)

2006.01.24, SJ

Spam quarantine cgi utility has been created
(Makefile.in, spamcgi.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, example.conf)

2006.01.23, SJ

Spamicity value is printed with %.4f
(clapf.c)

CDB handling was rewritten to use only a single cdb database
Forced database creation from mysql database can be done
just add a 3rd argument as "x" to util/mysql2cdb.sh.

eg: sh util/mysql2cdb.sh tokens my.cnf x

(bayes.c, cfg.c, cfg.h, perl/mysql2markov.pl, util/mysql2cdb.sh)

2006.01.19, SJ

Delivery information is written to the quarantine
directory when a file is put there. It may be used
to determine whose messages it is or to have it
delivered back to postfix.
(misc.c, misc.h, clapf.c)

2006.01.18, SJ

Man pages went to doc/man

Added a similar fix to handle soft breaks in quoted-printable parts for better
parsing.
(parser.c, parser.h, misc.c)

2006.01.04, SJ

Introduced an alternate base64 decoder function without the openssl crypto library

whether the whole message is spam or not.

I got some emails containing such a content that the bayesian
module returned a spamicity value of 0.94xx which was treated
as not spam though it was. Since this value was really near
the spam limit I decided to lower the overall spam limit
a little to handle these cases too. Of course you may set
SPAM_LIMT and SPAM_OVERALL_LIMIT to the same value.

(config.h, clapf.c)

Introduced a new heuristic check: if the From: and To: address
is the same (bayes.c, heuritic.h, HEURISTIC)

make_md5_stuff() function replaced with make_rnd_string() which copies the random
bytes directly into the buffer avoiding the use of the MD5 hash algorithm.
