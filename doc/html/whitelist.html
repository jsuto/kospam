<h2>White list support</h2>

Clapf does maintain an internal (and dymanic) whitelist. If you have a partner
sends you lots of good emails, then his email address will be in the ham dictinary,
ie. his email address is associated with good emails. Then if he starts sending spam
later, then his email address will be on the good side no longer.<p/>

Additionally, if someone has sent you at least 10 good emails and 0 spam, and you have
enabled the enable_auto_white_list feature, then his email is automatically considered
as ham.

<pre>
enable_auto_white_list=1
</pre>

However clapf also supports a less intelligent whitelist. If the sender is on the
t_white_list table, then no spam check is performed (except blackhole/minefield),
and clapf will return 0.5 as the spamicity value.<p/>

If you want to use this feature, then apply the --enable-whitelist configure option:

<pre>
--enable-whitelist
</pre>

Then put the email addresses of your most critical partners to the t_white_list
sql table, eg.

<pre>
INSERT INTO t_white_list (email, uid) VALUES('aaa@domain.kom', 0);
</pre>

If you specify 0 as the userid, then the given email is whitelisted for every user,
otherwise only for the given user.<p/>
