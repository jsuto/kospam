1. Always backup your current clapf.conf file and the clapf database.

2. Do a "make install" to replace your old binaries, and other stuff.

3. If you already have a clapf.conf file "make install" will not
update it, you should review the newer config file and modify it
according to your settings.

4. Create the t_policy table, then update the user table according 
to the new db.sql schema:

alter table user add column policy_group int(4) default 0;
alter table user drop column action;
alter table user drop column pagelen;
