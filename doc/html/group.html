<h2>Token group types</h2>

Clapf supports different token group types:

<ol>

<li><strong>shared</strong><p/>

All users share a common token set. This may useful if use have plenty of users
and they have similar email patterns or if you don't have enough disks to store
many individual token sets. This may result in a lower accuracy.<p/>

If you want a shared database, then set <i>group_type=0</i> in clapf.conf.
</li>

<li><strong>merged</strong><p/>

You may create a global token database with the initial training, then your
users may customise it with their own messages. Clapf merges the two token
set (global + user) at run time, and uses the merged set for determining
probabilities.<p/>

It offers great flexibility and accuracy, but requires more disk space to
store the lots of tokens. If you add a new user later, the global database
presents a default training set, and provides out of the box filtering.<p/>

If you want a merged database, then set <i>group_type=1</i> in clapf.conf.
</li>

<li><strong>separate</strong><p/>

This way there are no common data. It's best for users with very different
email patterns. Every user has to train their filter from the first letter.
You may think about it as a special variant of the merged group, where there
is no global token set.<p/>

If you want this type,  then set <i>group_type=1</i> in clapf.conf, but do
not perform an initial training.
</li>
