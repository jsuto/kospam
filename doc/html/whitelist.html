<h2>White list support</h2>

Clapf does maintain an internal (and dymanic) whitelist. If you have a partner
sending you lots of good emails, then his email address will be in the ham dictinary,
ie. his email address is associated with good emails. Then if he starts sending spam
later, then his email address will be no longer on the good side, thus dropped from
the whitelist.<p/>

Additionally, if someone has sent you at least 10 good emails and 0 spam, and you have
enabled the enable_auto_white_list feature, then his email is automatically considered
as ham without further processing.<p/>

<pre>
enable_auto_white_list=1
</pre>

However clapf also supports another (and less intelligent) whitelist. If the sender is
on the t_white_list table, then no spam check is performed (except blackhole/minefield),
and clapf will return 0.5 as the spamicity value.<p/>

If you want to use this feature, then apply the --enable-whitelist configure option:

<pre>
--enable-whitelist
</pre>

Then put the email addresses and/or patterns (such as @google.com, .domain.com, ...)
of your most critical partners to the t_white_list sql table, eg.

<pre>
INSERT INTO t_white_list (email, uid) VALUES('aaa@an.exact.email.address', 0);
INSERT INTO t_white_list (email, uid) VALUES('@google.com', 0);
INSERT INTO t_white_list (email, uid) VALUES('yourpartner.com', 0);
....
</pre>

If you specify 0 as the userid, then the given email address or domain is whitelisted
for every user, otherwise only for the given user.<p/>

Please note that using this latter whitelist clapf needs to check sequentially for
all the possible matches for the given user.<p/>
